        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">September 14, 1938 

          </font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The last of the 

          summer petunias lent a splash of bright color to the small, smoothly-sown 

          yard of No. 715, 15th St. On the porch, a lazy black cat curled himself 

          against the leather cushion of the porch glider. The front door stood 

          ajar and through it a mild breeze carried the refreshing coolness of 

          an early September day into the living room to the right of the small 

          entrance hall. The fresh [serim?] curtains at the windows stirred lightly 

          with now and then a flurry when a cross current brought a stronger and 

          chillier breeze into the room. </font> </p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The day was Saturday 

          of September, 1938. It was a good day of a good year for James Jackson. 

          The day was good because only that morning he had made the last payment 

          on his eighteen-months old Plymouth car. The year was good because in 

          January he had been made second hand in the spinning room at $27.50 

          a week. The twelve percent cut which came in July reduced his wage to 

          a little less than $25 but that left enough for him to live on comfortably. 

          His wife worked in the mill until two months ago and made $15 a week. 

          </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">They have been 

          able to save for their first child which will arrive within the next 

          month. </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">James is thirty-two 

          and his straight, well-built body, clear complexion and bright eyes 

          stand as proof of the good health he has always enjoyed. He and his 

          wife now share their four-room house with his mother and his eighteen-year 

          old brother, Clarence. The young Jacksons and Mrs. Jackson occupy the 

          two bedrooms and Clarence sleeps on a cot in the roam which is used 

          as a combination of kitchen and dining room. This three-purpose room 

          has in it no space for storing the canned fruits and vegetables which 

          the older Mrs. Jackson prepared during the summer. Consequently the 

          jars have been arranged in neat rows across the corner near the fireplace 

          in the living room and just opposite the upright piano. There are two 

          hundred jars of beans, tomatoes, corn, peaches, pickles, and preserves. 

          All the vegetables were gathered from the Jackson garden just back of 

          the house. </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">James Jackson sat 

          in his living room on this Saturday in September and discussed the company 

          for which he works. "I don't know of a better company to work for," 

          he declared. "The officials here have the worker's interests at heart. 

          They've furnished us with a fine Auditorium where a person can find 

          free amusement if he wants to. They order coal in big lots and sell 

          it to us without profit for $6.50 a ton. They keep the houses in good 

          repair and rent them to us for almost nothing. I pay $1.50 a week for 

          my four rooms, bath room, and garage. If I didn't live in a company 

          house I'd have to pay $5 a week for a house not kept in as good condition 

          to this. </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"There are very 

          few people working in the mill who make less than $12 a week when they 

          work full time. Some of the help's sent out now and then as much as 

          a day out of a week to rest but never more than that. We make standard 

          goods -- sheets and pillow cases, you know -- and we generally have 

          orders on hand all the time. </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I feel like people 

          living here at this mill have as good or better chance for a decent 

          living as most people working in stores, in offices, and such places 

          where they don't make any more than we do and have a sight more house 

          rent to pay. </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Of course the 

          company don't have enough houses for all its help. There's some working 

          in the mills here that's paying $20 a month for rent because they caint 

          get a company house. But the majority of us has the advantage over other 

          working people when it comes to rent." </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">There was about 

          James Jackson spirit of well-being as he talked of the company and of 

          his own life. It seemed to spring from his conviction that he had worked 

          for what he had gotten and had gotten what he had worked for. </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">James, one of eight 

          children, was born on his father's small farm in Sampson County and 

          lived there until he was ten years old. By that time his father, who 

          had quit farming for railroad work a few years earlier, had decided 

          that a steady wage was better than the uncertainties of farm production 

          and farm prices. He moved his family first to Erwin Cotton Mill at Erwin, 

          then to the East Durham Mill, and later to the West Durham will where 

          James still lives. The elder Jackson died a year after his youngest 

          child, Clarence, was born. Up to that time all the children of school 

          age had been able to remain in school. James completed the eighth grade 

          after which he began a course in bookkeeping. Convinced that he was 

          not suited to the type of work he quit the course and went into the 

          spinning room at the age of fifteen. There he has remained and availed 

          himself of his opportunities to learn all he could about his work. He 

          has attended a number of the textile courses offered in night school 

          by the mill officials and he completed a correspondence course in textile 

          work from the International Correspondence Schools. </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Six years after 

          the elder Jackson's death his widow decided to moved out into the country, 

          but not too far for her children to drive into Durham for their work. 

          She bought on time-payment a home and six acres at Bragtown, about five 

          miles out, and here three of her children not yet old enough to work 

          in the mill raised truck produce. The children who worked in town took 

          the vegetables and sold them to certain stores which could handle all 

          the small farm could supply. </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">After eight years 

          the farm was paid for and the younger members of the family had secured 

          work in the mill. Mrs. Jackson rented her farm and moved back to the 

          mill village. Today all of her children except Clarence are married, 

          and half of them live at the mill while the others live in the country. 

          </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Clarence who is 

          now in the tenth grade has supported himself by working in the mill 

          since he was fifteen. He quit school after finishing the ninth grade 

          and after a lapse of three years he has decided to finish high school. 

          He is one of the sixty-five students attending the Durham High School 

          Co-operative Class, a class organized for working boys ambitious to 

          complete their high school training. It is conducted so as to fit in 

          with the working schedule of all of its members. Clarence who works 

          in the mill from 3:30 in the afternoon until 12 at night attends classes 

          in the morning from 9 o'clock until 12. "it's pretty hard," he says, 

          "but I'm going to stick it through this year and two more. After that, 

          I don't know what I'll do, but at least I won't be turned down for a 

          job just because I don't have a high school education. I may stay right 

          on in the mill and work up like James. There's not many jobs for the 

          working man that pays more than $25 a week. </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"And they don't 

          come by just wishing for 'em" James told his brother, that Saturday 

          he'd finished paying for his car. </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">She seems hewn 

          from rough granite, this woman who sits in her front room and talks 

          while her slowly changing expression brings at long intervals a kindly, 

          creeping smile to her ruddy face. Her features though definite and firm 

          in outline have a roughness which makes one think the chiseler laid 

          down his tools before the surface had been smoothed. Change and time 

          have moved about her and brought age to her body, but her mind has remained 

          impervious to change. The beliefs of her childhood are the mainstay 

          of her old age. </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">A tiny light of 

          learning come into her life as a child, and with creditable effort she 

          clung to it and passed it on in such measure as she could to her own 

          children. </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">I shall set down 

          in her own words the story of Ida Allen as she told it to me the other 

          day while I sat with her in her front room which contained a cheap settee, 

          two chairs, a table, and a linoleum rug. </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I was born in 

          Chatham County, the second of Sid Reagin's six children. Pa was a good 

          man, always sober and a steady worker. He was thoughtful of Ma and took 

          the best care of her he knowed how. Ma was a weakly woman and Pa seen 

          to it that she stayed in bed for four or five weeks after each one of 

          her children was born. He had a doctor with her every time too, and 

          not all poor folks in them days had doctors. </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Before going to 

          the field of a morning at such times when Ma was ailing, he'd lift her 

          outa bed and set her in a chair. When she got weary of settin' I'd go 

          and call Pa, and he'd come and put her in the bed agin. </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Before he was 

          married Pa had fought to help free the colored people. He never believed 

          that slavery was right and it taint. Pa never had much of a chance himself 

          and he never learned to write his name. For generations we've been poor 

          people and before me there was none in the family could read. Take Pa 

          though; he'd been glad of a little schoolin' if there'd been any way 

          for him to get it. I'll tell you why I know in a minute. </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Pa sent me to 

          a four month's school that cost him a dollar a month. They wasn't free 

          schools in them days and only a few got learning. But it was in me to 

          learn more then I could get in them four months. </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We lived on Stroud's 

          place then and Mrs. Stroud was my Sunday school teacher. She seen how 

          well I done my Sundry school lesson and she took to havin' me come to 

          her house for school lessons. I got to where I could do fair readin' 

          and writin' and figurin'. They was plenty in them days that got all 

          the schoolin' they ever had from Sundry school teachers that was willin' 

          to teach them for nothin'. </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Now comin' back 

          to Pa and the reason I think he'd been proud of a little learning. I've 

          never knowed a person that loved to hear readin' more than him. I got 

          to where I could read any part of the Bible with fair understandin', 

          and of a night after he'd gone to bed, tired out from a hard day's work, 

          I'd set and read to him by the light of a light'ood knot. He loved most 

          of all to hear about the kings of Israel. </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"They wasn't any 

          foolishness atall about Pa and his younguns was never seen at no sort 

          of party. He said a party was a place where young folks got in trouble 

          and he was goin' to help us stay outa trouble. Till this day I ain't 

          never been to no party and to no picture show neither. </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Folks seem awful 

          careless about love in these times to me. It taint a good thing for 

          young girls to read these love story magazines and such like. Hit puts 

          ideas in they heads that's got no business there. I've never read no 

          love story of no kind. Love ain't nothin' to be trifled with, and as 

          for goin' with first one and then the other I think its a pure sin. 

          </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"They was one boy 

          that come courtin' me and I married him. Bob Allen and me played together 

          when we was children, and then after we was both growed up he took to 

          walkin' home with me from Sunday School of a Sunday. He was twenty-three 

          and I was twenty when we got married. Bob was a wage hand then, gettin' 

          twenty-dollars a month. He kept on at that job and I worked such little 

          patches as I could get. When the children come along and was big enough 

          to work I sometimes raised two bales of cotton a year. We had our own 

          hogs and a cow, and we lived right well. </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Then Bob's health 

          give away. He took down with the consumption and he knowed he didn't 

          have long to live. He said that me and the children couldn't make a 

          living on the farm and he wanted to move to the cotton mill where the 

          children could take care of theyselves. They worked children in the 

          mills them days. You know, little ones not more then nine or ten year 

          old. </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"We moved to Carrboro 

          and the children went to work. They never made much but put together 

          it was enough to feed us. Then I took in washin' for awhile till I got 

          a chance to go to work in the mill. In less than two years Bob had wasted 

          away with the consumption and died. We was a long time payin' for his 

          buryin'. </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Eighteen year 

          ago we moved to Durham. We worked some at East Durham and then got on 

          here at West Durham. </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"My children are 

          all married now with families of they own -- all except Louise. Last 

          week she drawed $9 from the mill and it's like that most times. They 

          send her out for restin' pretty near a day out of every week and she 

          don't have a chance to draw full pay. Me and her and my son's child 

          live on that. My son Ned was killed on the railroad and he left his 

          wife with five children. I took Annie, next to the youngest, to raise 

          and since they ain't no way for me to make money the burden falls to 

          Louise. </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I've got one son 

          making $16 a week when he don't have to rest none but he's got six children 

          to support outa that. His daughter Ella had to be operated on for the 

          appendicitis in June and he's still payin' on her doctor's bill. </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"They's not a child 

          I've got that's really able to take care of me. I put in for the old 

          age pension, and after a long time it started comin' and come three 

          months. Now I don't get it no more. If I had education enough to put 

          my reasonin' down on paper, I'd write a letter to Governor Hoey and 

          explain to his that I'm almost compelled to have that $10 a month if 

          I keep on livin'. None of my children can write it for me either because 

          they ain't got no more learnin' than me. It was never so I could send 

          them to school much, and most of what they know is what I learnt 'em 

          myself. I've not got one that caint read and write some though. </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Old ones caint 

          get jobs no more, you know. I'm seventy-two. Maybe if they caint get 

          it straightened out about the old age pension they'll pass a law for 

          doin' away with us old ones that's in the way." </font>

          once brown hair is turning gray, and two front teeth are missing. He 

          lives with his wife Beth and his sixteen-year-old son William, in a 

          small three-roomed shanty. The house was once white but now is a dark 

          brown from the chipped paint and the dark rotted wood. The planks are 

          uneven, and in many places have holes or gaps. The kitchen/living room 

          consists of a old corroded stove, a wooden table with three half-rotten 

          chairs. The walls have the same appearance as the outside. The two bedrooms 

          are simple and only consist of two beds and a beat up trunk. </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"It has not always 

          been like this," says Mr. Jackson, "We owned a tobacco farm in Wilson. 

          We had a large white house, plenty of good food, good clothes,- then 

          along came ole Roosevelt, and his Emergency Banking Relief Act. He closed 

          our bank, and took all of our money, all of our hard-earned savings. 

          We were forced to sell the farm, all of the land, and all of our belongings. 

          We wondered the streets for months searching for work and shelter. Luckily, 

          I heard about a job at a mill in Durham." </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Beth Jackson is 

          a woman in her thirties, has long brown ragged hair and wears an old 

          stained blue and white dress everyday. Shortly after the Jacksons arrived 

          in Durham, Beth received permission from the superintendent of the mill 

          to learn how to fill batteries. She did so for three weeks, hoping she 

          will be offered a position and be paid. Her prayers were answered on 

          the third Saturday, "the superintendent called me over and said he was 

          going to put me to work." </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Beth states that 

          Walter is not content with his job. He is considered the best doffer 

          in the mill, however during full-time work he makes less than eight 

          dollars a week. "I once suggested that he should look into the WPA as 

          a carpenter." However he responded angrily and in disbelief, "I will 

          never work for the same people who took our money, our homes and our 

          lives." The subject was never mentioned again. "I feel sorry for him." 

          Beth says, "he used to be so well off, now he must be humiliated that 

          he can barely support his family." He is a bright handsome boy, who 

          is very loyal to his family. William constantly labors in the cotton 

          fields, deprived from using knowledge he had learned previously. He 

          now has no time for any sort of education. He returns home each day 

          with meager pay, a black dirty face, and soars and filth covering his 

          body. "I remember the days where all I had to worry about was school 

          work," William recalls, "Now I pick cotton for thirteen hours a day, 

          then return home being welcomed by a bowl of cold rice and cornmeal. 

          The mill owner, James, is cruel and does not treat the workers fairly, 

          however I need not mention any of this to my family, for it only causes 

          more concern and depression." </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Several groups 

          of mill workers joined a Union and striked, however the mill owners 

          destroyed the Unions. They fired the Union workers and blacklisted them. 

          Just like the textile worker strike in September of 34. "We know we 

          are treated unfairly, however, we must think of the other over 150,000 

          unemployed North Carolinians and their families suffering and in despair." 

          "I just hope this ends soon for I dread we will not be able to make 

          it through this era of suffering much longer." </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Jacksons are 

          not the only family suffering in this community, many other West Durham 

          Cotton Mill workers are experiencing the same misfortunes. The only 

          thing these men and women can do now is to be strong and pray this time 

          of suffering shall end soon. </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">If you should meet 

          Josephine Wallace you would more than likely say to yourself, "With 

          a little more 'finish' she'd be a good-looking woman." She has a high 

          forehead, well-shaped nose and mouth, and nice blue eyes. She keeps 

          abreast of the styles--perhaps a little too well--and she is never without 

          a permanent wave. Although she has worked in a cotton mill a good part 

          of her life she does not look more than her forty years. </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The ambition of 

          Josephine's life is to keep her five children, more particularly her 

          two daughters, out of the mill. She does not mind the hard work she 

          does each day because it is to provide advantages for her children. 

          She is making seventeen dollars a week and her husband twenty-two. They 

          apparently dread the impending wage out more than some families of lesser 

          means because they hate to curtail in any measure the standard of living 

          they have worked out for their family. </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">If you should go 

          to the Wallace home in all probability you would be greeted by one of 

          Josephine's neatly dressed and well-mannered children who would enter 

          into conversation with you as soon as you were both seated in the living-room. 

          The living room is a cheerful, homey place despite the misapplication 

          of color and the lack of taste in choice of ornaments. The door prop 

          is a big china cat which curls itself in indolent laziness and manages 

          to gaze at you no matter where you are seated. The mantel is adorned 

          with two miniature covered wagons, one polar bear, a cat group, and 

          a china center piece which features a little girl looking at a dog and 

          asking, "Can't you talk?" Wherever you turn in the room you are likely 

          to see a gaudy-looking piece of statuary but in a little while you do 

          not mind. Even the too much greenness of the flowered rug which is vying 

          with the colorful drapery ceases to annoy you. Inevitably you reach 

          the conclusion that the people who live here have created for themselves 

          a home. </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Wallaces are 

          congenial among themselves and they find friends who share their interest 

          in music. The bad-toned piano is the pride of the household. If Ira 

          Belle, the 17 year old daughter, were to come in during your visit whe 

          would ask you if you could play certain tunes and with a request that 

          she play them for you should would respond readily. She might play Tippy-Tippy-Ten, 

          a number or two from Snow White, several others from recent pictures, 

          and almost certainly Duke University's song. Ira Belle will take from 

          the music rack a number of hymn-books and hand them to you for your 

          inspection. Among them will be a compilation by Gypsy Smith, a favorite 

          of hers. Her grand-father Carrington who was born in England has told 

          her that when he was a lad he ran away from home and lived for a while 

          with the gypsy tribe to which Gypsy Smith belonged. When you put the 

          books aside Ira Belle will play for you a number of hymns which she 

          and members of her family have sung in duet and quartet combinations 

          at the local churches during revivals. </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Wallace children 

          are proud of their mother and father. Josephine has told her children 

          that their father traces his ancestry back to the Wallace clan that 

          saved the Crown of Scotland, and that gives the two girls a certain 

          feeling of security as they attend the Durham High School. Ira Belle 

          thinks that many more of the mill girls would go on through high school 

          if they were not made to feel inferior by classmates who have had superior 

          advantages. The past year she was secretary of her section, in which, 

          as she expresses it "All the girls were nice, smart girls and none of 

          them high falutin'." Both of the girls say that Josephine has always 

          seen to it that they were as neatly dressed as anybody in their classes. 

          </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">One point of pride 

          with Josephine's children is the fact that their father who had very 

          little grade school education passed a correspondence course dealing 

          with arithmetic. Josephine herself went through the seventh grade because 

          a certain security in her home made it necessary for her to start to 

          work until she was fourteen. </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Josephine Wallace 

          is the oldest of five children born to David and Josephine Carrington. 

          David, one of six children, was born in Bidston, Cheshire County, England. 

          His father, a watchmaker and diamond setter, sent him to grade school 

          from the time he was three until he was eleven. At eleven he entered 

          Brassie's Shipyard and worked until he was fifteen. Joining the English 

          navy then he served for eight years and came out a skilled mechanic. 

          Service had brought him to the Atlantic Coast of the United States and 

          in David's words he had become a "free-thinker and wanted to spend the 

          rest of his days in the United States. England in those days was too 

          conservative for me." Shortly thereafter, having made his way to North 

          Carolina, he met and married Josephine Smith who lived in the backwoods 

          country near Sanford. Josephine had to her credit only six months of 

          schooling. Her father had come home from the War between the States 

          crippled with arthritis and unable to do manual labor at all. His girls 

          worked hard on the small farm which he owned and managed to subsist 

          in a meager sort of way. David's skill as a mechanic, when a skilled 

          mechanic was hard to find, made it possible for him to keep a job and 

          make Josephine's life a little easier than it had been. Soon after he 

          was married his pay was increased from seventy-five cents to a dollar 

          and a quarter a day. When he told Josephine the good news she exclaimed 

          "My Lord, that makes us rich folks for sure." She says that no money 

          has ever made her prouder than that first week's wages with the raise 

          for it seemed such a big amount after the lean., hard days she'd known 

          on the farm. From then on David made a fairly decent living for his 

          family and by the year 1912 he had a small bank account. </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">At that time letters 

          from England reminded him that his mother was ageing fast and her health 

          was failing. David could not overcome the desire to see his mother again. 

          He sold all of his property except his household goods and with his 

          wife and three children went to England. After a month's visit among 

          his people, David and his family returned to North Carolina on the Aquitania. 

          </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Shortly after his 

          return David secured a job as a mill mechanic in West Durham and he 

          has been there since. Josephine as the oldest of the children felt the 

          need of contributing to the family at an earlier age than the others. 

          Then, too, all the girls of her age that she knew had entered the mill. 

          Her younger brothers and sisters attained the age of fifteen before 

          their life in the mill began. One of her brothers is married to a nurse 

          and one of her sisters whose husband owns two houses in Asheville is 

          supervisor in a cigarette factory in Richmond. The other brother and 

          sister are married and working in the same mill with Josephine. </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Josephine is proud 

          of her father and mother. She likes to tell you that the older Josephine, 

          now sixty-one, got another permanent last week. She will look at the 

          large photograph of her which stands on the piano, and say "That's a 

          good picture but lot of folks have told me they didn't think it done 

          mama justice." If her father's name is brought into the conversation 

          she will probably tell that he is a thirty-second degree Mason. </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Josephine's ambition 

          for her children is hardly more pronounced than is her husband's. He 

          is determined to educate his children so that they may make a living 

          of which they will not be ashamed. Though Tom Wallace's father became 

          Chief of Police of Burlington before his death, the older ones of his 

          seven children knew many hard days and were glad of a chance to work 

          in the mill when they were no more than ten or eleven years old. </font> 

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Wallaces have 

          not saved any money during their married life but they have provided 

          their children with a respectable home. If Josephine's health holds 

          out and the mill continues to need them both they plan to send all their 

          children through high school and to give the two girls business training 

          to equip them for the profession of court stenographer. </font>
