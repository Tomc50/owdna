        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">At the other end
          of Broad Street (south of the railroad tracks) was Monkey Top and Monkey
          Bottom. Here, Dewey and Nettie Carden stand in front of their home at
          404 Case Street in Monkey Bottom (so named because some monkeys who
          escaped from their cage at nearby Erwin Auditorium were never found)</font>.</p>
        <p>&quot;I lived for many years in Monkey Bottom, between Swift<br>
          Avenue and Erwin Field. I trudged through the woods to<br>
          Campus Drive and caught rides to class sometimes. We<br>
          bought groceries from Mrs. Jackson, a dignified<br>
          Christian lady of seventy-five who sold a few things<br>
          in one room of her three-room house. Some of us would<br>
          try new items when her welfare checks got screwed up,<br>
          or when the rent went up on her, or when the wholesale<br>
          house quit selling half-cases and only sold whole<br>
          cases of things. Or when it was cold. She makes<br>
          home-made butter, and buttermilk, and she gave us<br>
          collard greens and turnips from her garden. She used a<br>
          crutch and had bad arthritis; and she always hugged<br>
          us, even when we were really hairy.</p>
        <p>I remember how hard it was for her when the city [at<br>
          Duke's request] tore down a fourth of the houses in<br>
          Monkey Bottom. They had to move the route of the new<br>
          highway so a nursing home for rich but homeless old<br>
          people could be built. The houses got removed, the<br>
          others moved away out of Durham, and the lots waited<br>
          two years empty. They are empty now.</p>
        <p>Some students bought a Monkey Bottom house and fixed<br>
          it up very creatively. When they moved, they sold it<br>
          to Duke. Duke decided not to rent it to anybody. A<br>
          friend of mine stayed there for a while, but Duke<br>
          found out and tore the place down, to save taxes and<br>
          &quot;prevent vandalism.&quot; Duke gets all the houses it can<br>
          unless it runs out of money. The neighborhood was<br>
          re-zoned &quot;commercial&quot; last summer. I forget why.&quot;<br>

        <p><b>Eckerd's Drug Store</b></p>
        <p><i>The following essay was submitted with the photograph by Laura McAllister
          on April 21, 1983.<br>

          <FONT COLOR=Navy> <font size="2">Eckerd's Drugstore (with Broad Street
          gas station in background).</font></font></p>

        <p><font size="2">The first time I observed the other customers from my

          seat at the Eckerd's counter, I saw many different faces--some bored,

          some sad, none of them seemingly connected. But it wasn't long before

          I discerned that there is a group of regulars who frequent Eckerd's

          at various times throughout the day. </font></p>

        <p><font size="2">These retired and semi-retired men come to Eckerd's

          not because of the food or ambiance, but out of a need to occupy themselves.

          At first this realization struck me as terribly sad because I saw nothing

          beyond the men's loneliness. But after having gotten to know them, I

          realized that they don't feel sorry for themselves; therefore, there

          was no reason for me to. These men live to the best of their ability.

          All who are physically able continue to work--Ralph at the mill, Ector

          for Duke Laundry, Riley at the Rock Shop. And whether they work or not,

          they plan their days. Woody watches a lot of television. Wimpy takes

          long walks. Ector goes fishing. Riley tends his garden. </font></p>

        <p><font size="2">What ties these men together is the time they spend

          at Eckerd's. It is the only place in West Durham where they can sit

          down next to a familiar face and be greeted warmly by waitresses as

          loving as Dot and Kathryn. </font></p>

        <p><font size="2">Yet despite the camaraderie shared among these men and

          the contentment with their lives illustrated in some of the pictures,

          there remains a sad element in the faces of the individuals that is

          also captured on film. Perhaps it is because their lives are slower

          paced than most that these men appear to feel and express more, whether

          the emotion be happy or sad. For whatever reason, elder people, much

          like children, possess a rich quality of expression which many of us

          seem to lack in our middle years. </font></p>

        <p><font size="2">The mannerisms and characteristics of the men I photographed

          at Eckerd's fascinated me from the very beginning and getting to know

          them has been a joy. The photographs have been an additional reward.
