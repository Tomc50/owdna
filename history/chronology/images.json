Local builder Joe Berini (whose father came to Durham to work as a stone mason at Duke Chapel) spent his childhood in a house on Hillsborough Road -- near Wallace Electric. In the 1920s, Hillsborough was a dirt road and often muddy.  Berini recalls that prior to Durham annexing West Durham in 1925, the neighborhood had running water but no sewage services. As a result, most homes had outhouses in the back yard. He also remembers that Duke's current Central Campus, and along Erwin Road, was a large neighborhood of mill homes. \"Erwin Auditorium was the best thing ever done in Durham,\" Berini said. \"Kids came home from school and had a place to go.\" Finally, Berini recalls people used to fish at the large mill pond on Hillsborough Road (near Carolina Ave). \"They were crazy. You'd never know what was in that water.\"  (Photo courtesy of Historic Preservation Society of Durham)."
