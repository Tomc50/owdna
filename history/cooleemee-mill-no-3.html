<h2>Cooleemee Mill No. 3</h2>

        <p>Though the faces have changed through the years, JC Sell, Jr. says 
          many things about Cooleemee have stayed the same. For one, townspeople 
          still live in the original mill houses built by Erwin Mills, though 
          many have been renovated, added onto or moved.</p>

        <p>Erwin Mills ran the town when Sell was growing up. Most of the townspeople 
          worked at the mill and lived in houses owned by the mill. The rent was 
          low, and Erwin's employees spent their time away from work enjoying 
          the swimming pool, library and two theaters owned by the company.</p>
        <p>Because most people used the space outside their homes for gardens, 
          Sell says garages provided by the mill were lined up at central locations 
          in town. When they went somewhere, people would park their cars in the 
          garages and walk back home. Most of Erwin's employees walked to work.</p>
        <p>Cooleemee even had its own hotel back then. The Riverside Hotel was 
          owned by Erwin so that company employees had a place to stay when they 
          came in from headquarters in Durham.</p>

        <p>The town also had its own Minor League baseball team, sponsored at 
          times by the St. Louis Cardinals. The ball field was located across 
          from Sell's house where Cooleemee Elementary School now stands, and 
          boys from town would climb the huge walnut tree behind his house to 
          watch the games.</p>
        <p>When Erwin Mills, which eventually became Burlington Mills, closed 
          down, Sell says, "it was like the town&acute;s heart stopped beating."
