          Philanthropist and Erwin Mills general manager, Edward Knox Powe had 
          this Neoclassical Revival style house, with two-story portico, built 
          during the late 1890s shortly after marrying Claudia Josephine Erwin. 
          The combination of fanciful molded woodworking around the entrance, 
          latticed window sashes and very tall interior chimneys with corbelled 
          stacks is typical of later Victorian architecture. Before the arrival 
          of the Durham Freeway, the Powe property extended south to Hull Street. 
          Today the Powe House is listed on the National Register of Historic 
          Places. (source: HPSD) </font></p>

          noted Durham textile executive and director of Southern Railway, had 
          this two-story frame house built around 1904. According to a popular 
          local tradition, when the Ringling Brothers, Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus 
          visited Durham early in the 20th century and was camped nearby across 
          the railroad tracks, Mr. Ringling visited Sunnyside to ask about the 
          pebble dash exterior for his own house-building project. In 1914, Erwin 
          covered the pebble dash with cedar shake shingles and added a wraparound 
          porch with Tuscan columns. </font></p>

          of the Blue Light on Erwin, near Pettigrew</font></b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Hello West Durham. 
          My name is Lois Ramsey. I was born in Durham on May 25, 1935 to J.D. 
          and Nettie Carden. I was born on Edith Street. My mother and father 
          worked at Erwin Mills. I grew up in West Durham and went to E.K. Powe 
          School. We lived on Case Street in Monkey Bottom. I went to work for 
          Sam Boy at the Blue Light around 1956. When I worked there the Esso 
          Station was going full force also. This was also owned by the Boy Family. 
          By this time I had married and was Lois Bennett. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> I worked at the 
          Blue Light when we had car hops (good old days) I remember one young 
          man Ervin Hester who later became a newscaster for WTVD. He a was a 
          very ambitious young man. Sam had a room down stairs at the Blue Light 
          called the Ratskeller. I workd the evening shift from 4PM to midnight. 
          When I would get a break I would go through the kitchen and take the 
          freight elevator to the basement to look in the room. The Blue Devil 
          football team hung out there. I had the pleasure of meeting Sonny Jergenson 
          there who later went pro and played for the Redskins. I also got a friend 
          of mine a job there, Gladys Carrington who still works for John Boy 
          at the Quik Shop. This is the only job Gladys has ever had. I met my 
          present husband while I worked at the Blue Light. He was working for 
          Daniel Construction Co. They were building the Biological Science Building 
          at Duke University he was the field engineer. So you see the Blue Light 
          has a special in my heart as does Sam and Gerry Boy. I am proud of my 
          heritage and my home town. </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Established in 
          1893, the families of workers from Erwin Mills on Ninth Street buried 
          their dead at this little-known cemetery on West Pettigrew Street for 
          100 years. The cemetery is of historic significance in the South because 
          African Americans were buried beside whites at a time when even graveyards 
          were, for the most part, strictly segregated by race. </font> </p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The Old West Durham 
          Neighborhood Association organized three clean-ups of the cemetery -- 
          clearing several truckloads of underbrush and coming back to plant daffodil 
          bulbs, paint the fence and install two cemetery signs. Because of its 
          historic connection to the neighborhood, OWDNA voted unanimously to 
          amend its bylaws and include the cemetery as part of Old West Durham.</font>

        <p>Excerpt of UNC interview with Mrs. Theotis Williamson, who worked at 
          Erwin Mills from 1915 to 1960.</p>
        <p>Lanier Rand: Where is the mill cemetery?</p>
        <p>Mrs. Theotis Williamson: It's up the hill on Burrow Road. You have 
          to go in and back out, because I went to a funeral up there not too 
          long ago.</p>
        <p>LR: They still use that?</p>
        <p>TW: Yes. But this man that was buried there then, he was eighty-something 
          years old. I had known him years and years down there, and I went to 
          his funeral. It's a beautiful place up there, but it's scary. I've often 
          wanted to go back and go in there with somebody with me.</p>
        <p>LR: Maybe you and I could go up there some time, because I'd like to 
          see it. I don't know where it is. I could come get you.</p>
        <p>TW: Well, we'll go some day then.</p>
        <p>LR: Because I've never been up there; I don't even know where it is.</p>
        <p>TW: Well now, I'll tell you, it's back in the woods. You won't be afraid?</p>
        <p>LR: [laughter] No.</p>
        <p>TW: I'm not afraid either.</p>
        <p>LR: Well, we'll go together then [laughter]. That must be the key.</p>
        <p>TW: Yes, yes. That's history; let me tell you something, that's history.</p>
        <p>LR: Boy, I'm sure!</p>
        <p>TW: It's the most sacred place you ever seen. I just think it's the 
          most sacred place. Now we had to get out and walk across the railroad 
          tracks. The only two things that went in there were the family car and 
          hearse.</p>
        <p>LR: And everybody else just walked?</p>
        <p>TW: Yes, you had to walk.</p>
        <p>LR: Because it's real small?</p>
        <p>TW: Because it's grown up so. I don't think anybody'll bother us.</p>
