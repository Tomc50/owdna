          offer their visions of Ninth Street </b></font> </p>
        <p> (Herald-Sun, 23 March 2003)</p>
        <p><font size="2">One street, 14 visions. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Old West Durham residents came to Blacknall Church&acute;s 
          fellowship hall Friday to take a look at what a group of N.C. State 
          University students created for a Ninth Street of the future, and many 
          reacted in a why-hasn&acute;t-anyone-thought-of-that manner. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The 14 NCSU College of Design students developed ideas 
          for Ninth Street and the upcoming Triangle Transit Authority lightrail 
          station planned for the area as part of a landscape and architecture 
          studio class, and their visions struck a chord with residents. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Nearly all concepts focused on offering more options 
          to people who want to walk or bike through the area. Many also designed 
          parks and civic and open spaces integrating the TTA station with the 
          existing community. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">"These guys are thinking outside the box," said John 
          Schelp, president of the Old West Durham Neighborhood Association. "It&acute;s 
          special to see it &#133; we are not talking much money here." </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Changes are on the way because of the TTA station and 
          the ongoing revitalization of Duke University&acute;s East Campus and 
          nearby properties, so it is cheaper to incorporate the students&acute; 
          ideas as projects start, Schelp said. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">"We will take the exciting plans and we will put them 
          up on our web site and share them with the community," Schelp said. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The NCSU College of Design students met with City/County 
          Planning Department employees and the neighborhood association, in addition 
          to walking through the area to talk to residents and business owners 
          to get a better sense of it, said professor Kofi Boone, who contacted 
          residents and city officials at the beginning of the semester. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The project gave them a chance to think about real problems 
          instead of abstract ones, Boone said. On Friday, they explained their 
          ideas to the public and defended the thoughts behind their projects, 
          which was a valuable exercise for them, he said. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Many students felt the Ninth Street area was already 
          pedestrian-friendly, but was somewhat isolated. The projects "connected 
          the dots," Boone said, linking the area to neighbors such as Duke University 
          East Campus and Brightleaf Square. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">In the vision of student Himnae Yoo, a vacant lot near 
          the George&acute;s Garage restaurant would be transformed into a park, 
          which would have a pond. A ramp -&#151; so people could not only walk 
          but bike to the TTA station &#151; would connect the light-rail station 
          to the Ninth Street area. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Students did research and looked at old maps to understand 
          the area better, she said. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">"It is close to the downtown area, so it can lose its 
          character if we ignore the history of the area," Yoo said. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Student Sarah Laster focused on the area next to Green 
          Street, where the South Ellerbe Creek natural area is on city books 
          as a future park. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The park would work as a transition between the residential 
          portion of the Old West Durham neighborhood and the business area toward 
          Main Street, she said. Her plans included an amphitheater, a plaza and 
          a boardwalk so people could experience the wetlands without disturbing 
          them. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">To have something concrete to work on is always better 
          than abstract, Laster said. She came to Ninth Street armed with a digital 
          camera at least five times to develop her project. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">"It would be an incredible jewel for Durham to have 
          some of these [improvements]," said resident Mark Dessauer. "Hopefully, 
          it won&acute;t be something only for the walls." </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Simple ideas like having parking decks instead of "a 
          sea of concrete" as a parking lot, or turning the "desolate" alleys 
          into vibrant parts of businesses as some students envisioned are both 
          easy on pocketbooks and attainable, he said. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">"Everybody&acute;s intention is to make it more pedestrian-friendly," 
          said developer Glenn Dickson with Ninth Street North, a retail and office 
          development north of Markham Avenue. "You can tell they&acute;ve done 
          a lot of information-gathering to get to where they are." </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Some of the ideas, such as the amphitheater, are complex, 
          but others, like placing benches and artwork along the sidewalks and 
          preserving open areas, could easily be accommodated in development, 
          he said.</font></p>
