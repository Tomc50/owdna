              is Duke planning to do with Central
              Campus?</strong></font></font></font></p>

              <p>Duke is planning a large-scale revitalization of
              its Central Campus to build a "university village" of
              retail shops and other amenities to keep students on
              campus, and out of Durham.</p>

              <p><strong>Why is Duke planning changes to Central
              Campus?</strong></p>

              <p>The apartments have outlived their useful life and
              Duke has a wonderful opportunity to use the fruit of
              its recent capital campaign, about $2 billion in
              tax-advantaged dollars, to push the envelope of
              investing this tax-free money to turn a profit, under
              the rubric of providing for future educational
              needs.</p>

              <p><strong>Where is Central Campus and how big is
              it?</strong></p>

              <p>Central Campus consists of about 200 acres bounded
              by Medical Center and West Campus on three sides and
              the neighborhood of Old West Durham to the north.</p>

              <p>Before the student apartments were built in the
              1970s, the area was home to 450 mill houses for the
              nearby Erwin Mills (at the time, Duke officials asked
              the City to condemn all the mill houses). The Duke
              School for Children has been asked to move.</p>

              <p>The area also includes Erwin Soccer Field -- which
              Duke recently tried to buy in a quiet back-room deal.
              The scheme failed after Duke officials were exposed
              by two soccer dads.</p>

              <p><strong>What is the current zoning?</strong></p>

              <p>Thanks to the strong support of partnership
              neighborhood representatives speaking to Durham City
              Council -- East, West and the Medical Center were
              re-zoned "University College" in 2004. (Before that,
              Duke's campus was non-conforming.)</p>

              <p>Central Campus is now mostly zoned as
              single-family and multi-family residential. This area
              was not rezoned University-College, along with the
              rest of the campus in 2004, because Duke had wanted
              to build on-campus retail (beyond the academic
              mission of the university).</p>

              <p><strong>What's the timeline?</strong></p>

              <p>The timeline on Duke's website starts in March
              2004. It ignores the February 2003 meeting (initiated
              by Duke) with 18 representatives of 12 partnership
              neighborhoods -- where the community discussed campus
              land use plans and first raised concerns about
              Central Campus retail.</p>

              <p>See... <a href=
              "Duke-NhoodTimeline.htm">http://www.owdna.org/Duke-NhoodTimeline.htm</a></p>

              <p><strong>What initiatives might Phase I
              include?</strong></p>

              <p>In addition to the general aim of addressing ‘the
              need for beds and food services’ described by Duke,
              testing and preparing the local political landscape
              is clearly an objective of Phase I. The Duke
              administration has engaged in a long series of
              newspaper columns that raise more questions than they
              answer, meetings yielding promises later threatened
              or broken, rude posts to community bulletin boards
              and then followed by patronizing attempts to calm the
              unrest caused by these actions. Duke has exhibited a
              general policy of ‘trust what we say and don’t pay
              attention to what we do,’ so as to take the local
              political temperature and assess what they can get
              away with.</p>

              <p><strong>How will decisions be made?</strong></p>

              <p>Tallman Trask will determine priorities. Every
              once in a while, carefully chosen items will be
              shared with the public and feedback will be
              accepted.</p>

              <p><strong>Who is involved in the planning process
              and how were they selected?</strong></p>

              <p>This is an internal planning process involving
              mostly Tallman Trask III. (The community asked to
              participate on the planning committees but Duke
              refused.)</p>

              <p><strong>How can citizens contribute input to the
              planning process?</strong></p>

              <p>Basically, Duke is saying they will accept no
              formal input from anyone outside of their internal
              planning process. The <a href=
              "Duke-NhoodTimeline.htm#retail">previous
              attempts</a> at having input i.e. the list of retail
              uses for Central Campus agreed upon by the
              Partnership Neighborhoods, are exactly what Duke is
              fudging on now, by not committing to
              University/College zoning. People can keep up with
              what Duke decides through an elaborate public
              relations process which even includes a full time
              community relations officer. But there is no
              indication that Duke will do anything other than what
              is best for Duke, as their sense of 'fiduciary
              responsiblity' (read: 'invest money to make money')
              dictates.</p>

              <p><strong>How much retail space will be included in
              the development?</strong></p>

              <p>Duke has announced they have a 'fiduciary
              responsibility' to make money whenever and wherever
              they can, purportedly in support of the educational
              mission that provides them with tax-exempt status for
              soliciting contributions. In other words, Duke will
              try to build as much retail as it can get away
              with.</p>

              <p><strong>I've heard that Duke is proposing building
              stores on campus that will keep students away from
              Ninth Street businesses. Is that true?</strong></p>

              <p>Yes, along with Brightleaf Square, locally-owned
              Northgate Mall and other nearby business
              districts.</p>

              <p><strong>Are there any best practices for campus
              development that Duke can look to as a
              model?</strong></p>

              <p>Nope. No other university has tried to build this
              much non-academic retail on campus. No other
              university has tried to avoid paying this much in
              property taxes -- keeping more money on campus and
              out of their host towns.</p>
