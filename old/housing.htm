          </i>What is the Housing Code?</P>
        </B> 
        <P><B>Answer: </b>The Housing Code is the law that says all homes in the 
          City of Durham should be safe, livable and healthy. ("Homes" means single-family 
          houses, apartments, boarding rooms and all other living units.) All 
          homes must have heat, a smoke detector, door locks and good maintenance. 
          Most basic maintenance concerns such as heating, electrical and plumbing 
          problems, leaking roofs or broken windows are covered by the Housing 
          Code. Concerns about appearance, such as worn carpeting, are not covered.</P>
        <B> 
        <P>How do I get my home repaired?</P>
        </B> 
        <P><B>Answer: </b>When repairs need to be made to your home, notify your 
          landlord <U>in writing</U>. In an emergency, call first and then write. 
          You can hand-write your request for repairs. If the landlord does not 
          make repairs promptly, <B>call the City Housing Inspectors</B> <B>at 
          560-4570.</b></P>
        <P><B>Can my landlord evict me for riling</b> <B>a housing code complaint?</b></P>
        <P><B>Answer: NO! </b>It is illegal for a landlord to evict a tenant for 
          filing a housing code complaint with a Housing Inspector for 12 months. 
          But you must continue to pay rent and follow any other requirements 
          in the lease. If threatened with a retaliatory eviction, contact the 
          Housing Inspector and <B>Legal Assistance, 688-6396.</b></P>
        <P><B>Can I</b> <B>report housing problems without</B> <B>using my name?</b></P>
        <P><B>Answer: </b>Yes. But, because of the type of problem reported, the 
          landlord may know that the tenant has complained. If you are uncomfortable 
          filing a complaint on your own, you could consider contacting your neighborhood 
          organization or religious institution to file<B> </B>a complaint as 
          a group. You <U>do not</U> have to live in the home in order to report 
          a housing code violation.</P>
        <P><B>My landlord is refusing to make repairs</b> <B>to my home. Do I 
          have to pay my rent?</b></P>
        <P><B>Answer: YES! </b>You have to pay your rent. You can go to Small 
          Claims Court to get your rent reduced until your home is repaired. Call 
          the <B>Clerk of Court, 560-6823, </B>to find out how to file a complaint 
          in Small Claims Court. The cost of filing a complaint is $39, but you 
          can ask for the fee to be waived, or, if you win, the fee is paid back.</P>
        <P>If you plan to go to Small Claims Court, you should keep copies of 
          all of your requests to your landlord for repairs. You should always 
          request repairs in writing, unless it is an emergency.</P>
        <P>You can go to Small Claims Court by yourself or with a lawyer.</P>
        <P>I <B>can't afford a lawyer. How do I get</B> <B>legal help?</b></P>
        <P><B>Answer: </b>You can get free legal help from North Central Legal 
          Assistance, if you meet income qualifications. If you do not qualify 
          for assistance, they will refer you to a lawyer. <B>Call Legal Assistance 
          at 688-6396.</b></P>
        <P><B>What is my landlord required to</b> <B>provide in my home?</b></P>
        <DIR> 
          <P><B>Answer: </b>This list includes <U>some</U> items a landlord is 
            required to provide.</P>
          <P><B>Source of Heat: </b>Central or space heating units designed for 
            continuous use and able to safely heat all rooms must be provided. 
            Portable kerosene or electric heaters are <U>not</U> adequate.</P>
          <P><B>Smoke Detectors: </b>All sleeping areas must have smoke detectors 
            (battery or electric).</P>
          <P><B>Electrical: </b>Wiring should be enclosed. Light switches and 
            outlets should be safe to use.</P>
          <P><B>Hot Water: </b>A water heating unit is required.</P>
          <P><B>Plumbing: </b>Safe water must be supplied. Plumbing and fixtures 
            should be maintained in good working condition and should not leak. 
            Pipes should be protected from freezing.</P>
          <P><B>Roofs:&#9;</b>The roof should be weatherproof with no leaks.</P>
          <P><B>Locks:&#9;</b>All exterior doors must have locks that can be operated 
            from inside and outside the home (such as dead bolts or night latches). 
            Barrel bolts and padlocks are not adequate.</P>
          <P><B>Screens or Air Conditioning: </b>Landlords do <U>not</U> have 
            to provide air conditioning. Homes without central air must have screens 
            on all operable doors and windows in good repair from May I through 
            November 1.</P>
          <P><B>Windows: </b>Windows should be easy to open and close. Glass should 
            not be broken.</P>
          <P><B>Railings </b>must be on steps over 4 feet high.</P>
          <P><B>Adequate Kitchen Cabinet Space: </b>Kitchens must have adequate 
            counter space and enclosed kitchen cabinets.</P>
        </DIR>
        <B> 
        <P>What are the responsibilities of a tenant?</P>
        </B> 
        <P><B>Answer: </b>The tenant is responsible for paying rent on time, not 
          deliberately damaging the home, keeping the property clean and safe, 
          and informing the landlord of needed repairs <U>in writing</U>. If it 
          is an emergency, call the landlord immediately, then write a note as 
          soon as possible.</P>
        <P><B>There are rats in my crawl space. Is this</b> <B>a housing code 
          violation?</b></P>
        <P><B>Answer: </b>Yes. Rats are a violation of the Housing Code. If the 
          rats are entering your home because of holes or other problems, the 
          landlord is responsible for making repairs. The landlord is required 
          to exterminate the rats if you are renting an apartment with 2 or more 
          units. The tenant is responsible for extermination in a single-family 
          home.</P>
        <P>If rats are a problem outside your home, <B>call Animal Control at 
          560-0630.</b></P>
        <P><B>Who should I call if my home or yard</b> <B>floods when it rains?</b></P>
        <P><B>Answer: </b>Call and write your landlord if the flooding causes 
          water to enter the home or the crawl space. If your landlord does not 
          respond, call a Housing Inspector, 560-4570.</P>
        <P><B>What can I do if there are weedy lots or</b> <B>overgrown yards 
          in my neighborhood?</b></P>
        <P><B>Answer: </b>If the weeds are higher than 12 inches and within I 
          00 feet of a public street or within 50 feet of a home, call a Housing 
          Inspector, 560-4570.</P>
        <P><B>What do I do if there is an abandoned</b> <B>vehicle on my street?</b></P>
        <P><B>Answer: </b>If the vehicle is on private property, call a Housing 
          Inspector at 560-4570. If it is on the street, call the Police, 911 
          or 560-4427.</P>
        <B> 
        <P>How do I get old appliances picked up?</P>
        </B> 
        <P><B>Answer: </b>You can get bulky items picked up by the City at a cost 
          of $20 for up to five items. If you bring items to the landfill, the 
          charge is $8 for a truck and $1 for a car. Four or fewer appliances, 
          with no other items, can be brought to the landfill free.</P>
        <P>During the City's Spring Clean Days or neighborhood clean-up days, 
          pickup is free. For information, <B>call Solid Waste</B> <B>Management 
          at 560-4185.</b></P>
        <P><B>What can I do if people are selling</b> <B>drugs in a home in my 
          neighborhood?</b></P>
        <P><B>Answer: Call 911 </b><U>and</U> <B>your Community</B> <B>Police 
          Officer at 560-4317. </B>Community Police Officers work on neighborhood 
          problems with residents.</P>
        <P>If police document at least two occurrences of drug activity at a property 
          in the past five years, the City can file a lawsuit against the property 
          owner. If the City wins, the owner will lose ownership of the property.</P>
        <P>If you own or live in housing built during or prior to 1978, you probably 
          have lead-based paint in your home. Lead-based paint that is flaking, 
          peeling, chipping or chalking can be a hazard. High levels of lead can 
          lead to poisoning and affect the development of young children.</P>
        <P><B>How do I find out if my child has been</b> <B>exposed to lead?</b></P>
        <P><B>Answer: </b>Children under six years old should be tested for lead. 
          -Free blood tests are done at the Health Department on a walk-in basis. 
          <B>Contact the Health Department, 560-7601.</b></P>
        <P><B>How do I find out if my home has lead</b> <B>hazards?</b></P>
        <P><B>Answer: </b>To find<B> </B>out if your home has lead hazards, get 
          your family tested for lead. If a child less than six years old has 
          elevated lead, the Health Department will do free tests of your home, 
          and other places the child stays.</P>
        <P><BR>
          You may be able to get your home tested by the <B>Northeast Central 
          Durham PFACH</B> <B>Project, 560-6422. </B>For a list of testing laboratories, 
          call the <B>Health Department's</B> <B>Environmental Health Division, 
          560-7800.</b></P>
        <P> <B>Who is responsible for reducing lead</b> <B>hazards in my home?</b></P>
        <P><B>Answer: </b>If a child under age 6 has elevated lead levels, the 
          Health Department will require the owner to abate any lead hazards in 
          a home where the child lives or stays.</P>
        <P>For more information, <B>contact the</B> <B>Environmental Health Division, 
          560-7800.</b></P>
        <P>I <B>am a homeowner and cannot afford to</B> <B>repair my house. Can 
          I get help?</b></P>
        <P><B>Answer: </b>Yes. Loans and grants are available to help low-income 
          homeowners repair their homes. Call the City Department of Housing at 
          560-4570.</P>

          home buyers. For more information, call the Durham Affordable Housing 
          Coalition at 683-1185, the Consumer Credit Counseling Service at 688-3381,
