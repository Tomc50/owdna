<P><b><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Friends 
  of South Ellerbe Creek</font></b><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
  is an informal group of citizens dedicated to conserving and enhancing the scenic, 
  recreational, natural and historic qualities of South Ellerbe Creek and its 
  landscape in the upper-Neuse River Basin. </font> 
<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Durham's streams 
  are among our city's most precious resources. Their waters anchor us, giving 
  us a sense of history and place. Their calming flow is a source of inspiration. 
  They are a crucial part of our environmental neighborhood. Like neighborhoods, 
  Durham's watersheds need to be protected. The quality of water in our streams 
  affects the quality of life for all living things. But growth and development 
  threaten the health of Durham's streams. Pushed to their limits, our streams 
  now show signs of stress. </font> 
<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Urban creeks are 
  the most neglected and degraded creeks in the nation -- polluted, channelized, 
  littered, and forgotten. Yet, these streams contribute to urban drinking water, 
  and also provide recreation and refuge from concrete and asphalt. Restored rivers 
  help make cities livable again, offer many urban residents a significant connection 
  to nature, and provide enormous benefits for public health, recreation, economic 
  growth, and community pride.<br>
  <br>
  </font> 
<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">From its headwaters 
  near the Food Lion on Hillsborough Road, South Ellerbe Creek flows for three 
  miles through some of Durham's oldest and most densely developed neighborhoods: 
  Old West Durham, Walltown, Northgate Park, Trinity Park. Another branch of South 
  Ellerbe flows north out of downtown Durham, through Durham Central Park and 
  Trinity Park -- before joining her sister near Club Blvd Elementary. South Ellerbe 
  then joins Ellerbe Creek in a small forest -- just northwest of the I-85/Roxboro 
  Road interchange. Along some wooded stretches, the creek quietly flows over 
  rocks and is as scenic as any in western North Carolina. In other areas, South 
  Ellerbe is a troubled creek. </font> 
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We don't know 
  if the potential pollution sources along the creek, are something to worry about 
  or not. However, South Ellerbe is surrounded by various auto and muffler shops, 
  large surface parking lots, a plumbing shop, funeral home, photo studio, small 
  apartment complex, a chemical storage facility, Southern Railroad, Business 
  Hwy 70, a Duke warehouse, and an old gas station. Many of these sites have direct 
  run-off into the creek. The storm drains in the vicinity lead directly into 
  the creek as well (pairs of storm drains near Hillsborough and Anderson streets 
  are easy to spot). </font> 
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">There is also 
  a large "dye pond" surrounded by a screened fence near the creek. The dye pond 
  remains from the Erwin textile mill. Run-off from the mill operations used to 
  flow into the neighborhood (apparently, in the past, the area often smelled 
  like a big laundromat from the warm, soapy water that flowed out of the mills). 
  </font> 
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The troubled creek 
  also flows under the large parking surfaces at Northgate Mall and along the 
  northern edge of Interstate-85 (the widening of this major corridor will have 
  a direct impact on the creek and its surroundings). </font> 
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Potential risks 
  associated with these pollution sources include possible residues in the water 
  or leaching into the surrounding soil and creek bed. </font> 
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">At its peaceful 
  confluence with Ellerbe Creek, one could almost forget the troubled history 
  of these waters. Few stretches remain that can still be protected. Fortunately, 
  we understand that South Ellerbe is covered by Durham's new Resource Protection 
  Ordinance (its headwaters drainage basin is greater than 25 acres and the creek 
  is designated on the USDA map). So, any new development would require stronger 
  buffers. </font> 
<p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Friends of 
  South Ellerbe Creek (FOSEC) will work to tell the <a href="ellerbee.htm">story</a> 
  of this troubled urban creek and will work to protect and enhance the qualities 
  of its watershed. <br>
