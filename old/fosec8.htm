        Friends of South Ellerbe Creek helped organize 40 stream clean-ups: 1) 
        with E.K. Powe Elementary (more than 50 volunteers cleared everything 
        from a wheelchair to an old toilet), 2) with Old West Durham Neighborhood 
        Association and the City Impact team (four truck loads), 3) with the Shodor 
        Education Foundation and Duke students (on Broad Street near West Knox), 
        4) with Old West Durham residents (the day Hurricane Floyd hit), 5) Walltown 
        Park (organized by Durham People's Alliance); 6) near West Club Blvd Elementary 
        where more than 30 volunteers cleared debris and placed "Protect South 
        Ellerbe" stickers on nearby storm drains (organized by high school senior 
        Jason Mortimer); 7) in Trinity Park area (near West Knox and Ruffin) with 
        Duke's Alpha Delta Pi; 8) near Broad and Knox with Shodor and Alpha Tao 
        Omega; 9) Along South Ellerbe Greenway (near Green and Ruffin) with Duke's 
        Phi Delta Theta; 10) Durham Central Park (downtown, near old Durham Athletic 
        Park); 11) Two days of clean-ups by Duke's Phi Delta Theta fraternity 
        (neglected section between Hillsborough Road and Carolina Avenue); 12) 
        South Ellerbe Natural Area (with students from Duke ROTC); 13) Duke Diet 
        Center (Watts Street Baptist at Trinity and North Duke); 14) Walltown 
        Park (75 volunteers from Walltown Community Association, Urban Hiker magazine, 
        Durham Rotary Club, Sierra Club, Environment First, National Institute 
        of Environmental Health Sciences, Old West Durham, Self-Help, Shodor Foundation, 
        Durham Rescue Mission, People's Alliance, Stormwater Services, Partners 
        Against Crime II, and City Council); 15) Ellerbe Greenway/East Coast Greenway 
        (Phi Delta Theta), 16) "Bridges clean-up" (Duke groups targeting the debris 
        that collects under many bridges that cross the stream), 17) Ruffin and 
        Green (Duke community service), 18) South Ellerbe Natural Area (Duke Navy 
        ROTC), 19) Club Blvd/south of Walltown Park, 20) Durham Central Park (Beth-El 
        synagogue, Watts Street), and several more along the east and west branches 
        (at this point we stopped keeping track of each outing). .</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">My name is Tom Hodges-Copple, 

  I am a fifth grader at E. K. Powe Elementary School. </font> </p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> Last year I worked with 

  a group of third, fourth, and fifth grade students and three teachers from E. 

  K. Powe to try and make South Ellerbe Creek a better place. We took pictures 

  of the Creek and then on one Saturday we worked with The Old West Durham Neighborhood 

  Association to clean up the creek. We cleaned up the whole section diagonal 

  to our school. We cleaned it up by moving shrubs and garbage from around the 

  Creek. You would not believe what we found! We found stuff like soccer balls, 

  mattresses and even a toilet. We had a huge pile of stuff collected from just 

  that one Saturday. </font> 

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> Also we worked with scientists 

  from Durham Storm Water Services. Some of the scientists tested the water. The 

  good part was that they found some little guys or animals in the water. That 

  was good because even though we found all that junk animals can still survive 

  in the water. </font> 

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> I think it is important 

  to help clean up the creek because there aren't a lot of creeks in this part 

  of Durham anymore. Animals need the Creek to live off of. Maybe someday it would 

  be cool if there were more places for us to play and study wildlife and nature. 

  Right now it is a neat place because it is still natural, we just need to keep 

  the junk out! <br>

        the Friends of South Ellerbe Creek helped pull a 'household of items'

        mattresses, a kitchen cabinet, old can of paint, rusted out barrel, children's 

        toys, tires of all sizes, soccer ball, fire extinguisher, and a wheelchair. 

        The group of volunteers also opened a small meandering path to the creek, 

        to provide safe access for E.K. Powe students working on their stream 

        watch activities. </font>
