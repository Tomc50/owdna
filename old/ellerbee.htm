        The Story of South Ellerbe Creek </B></FONT></P>
         
         
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000080"><BR>
        </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000">On a small rise near the Food Lion 
        on Hillsborough Road, a creek begins its journey toward the sea. Its headwaters 
        rise next to what was once the settlement of Pinhook, which served as 
        a traveler's rest on the dirt road between Hillsborough and Raleigh. </FONT></P>
      <P><font size="2">From its headwaters, South Ellerbe Creek flows for three 
        miles through some of Durham's oldest and most densely developed neighborhoods: 
        Old West Durham, Walltown, Northgate Park, Trinity 
  Park. Another branch of South Ellerbe flows north out of downtown Durham, through 
  Durham Central Park and Trinity Park -- before joining her sister near Club 
  Blvd Elementary. South Ellerbe meets Ellerbe 
        Creek in a wooded area -- just to the north and west of the I-85/Roxboro 
        Road interchange. </font></P>
         
         
      <P><IMG SRC="graphics/ellerbee/1.gif" WIDTH=398 HEIGHT=269 BORDER=1 ALIGN=bottom>&nbsp;<br>
        <font color="#0000CC" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Headwaters 
        of South Ellerbe Creek. </font></P>
      <P><font size="2">The first mile of the creek is surrounded by various auto 
        and muffler shops, large surface parking lots, a plumbing shop, funeral 
        home, photo studio, small apartment complex, Southern Railroad, Business 
        Hwy 70, a Duke warehouse, an old gas station, and a number of quiet back 
        yards. Its path will take it past three schools: E.K. Powe Elementary, 
        Brogden Middle and Club Blvd Elementary. </font></P>

        <img src="graphics/ellerbee/3.gif" width=197 height=297 border=1 align=bottom>&nbsp;<br>
        <font color="#0000CC" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Duke 
        warehouse serves as creek's left bank (L); South Ellerbe crosses under 
        Hillsborough Road with Greystone Baptist Church in the background (R). 
        </font> 
      <p><font size="2">And, the course of South Ellerbe Creek follows the history 
        of Durham itself. Blue collar in its origins, South Ellerbe flows through 
        some of the Bull City's most historic neighborhoods: Old West Durham was 
        built for workers in the textile mills and Walltown for workers in the 
        tobacco industry. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Long-time residents of the Erwin Mills village recall 
        that a sawmill was placed in the middle of the woods to cut the planks 
        to build the first mill houses -- along the creek. In the early days, 
        the entire neighborhood smelled like a Laundromat -- from the hot, soapy 
        water being discharged by the textile mills into South Ellerbe. Today, 
        this area forms the heart of the National Registry Historic District in 
        Old West Durham and the proposed 
        site for an urban green space. </font></p>

        <font color="#0000CC" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Broad 
        Street bridge: South Ellerbe flows from Old West Durham into Walltown 
        (foreground). </font> </p>
      <p><font size="2">In the late 1880s, a young African-American man named 
        George Wall followed his job with Trinity College to Durham. Wall bought 
        a wooded plot of land just north of what is now Duke's East Campus. Walltown 
        became a neighborhood for workers moving into the Bull City for the growing 
        tobacco industry. The narrow shotgun houses and small residences provided 
        easy access to the tobacco factories. </font></p>

        Quality monitor, Club Blvd crossing in Walltown (L); Walltown Park with 
        Northgate Mall looming beyond the trees (R). </font> </p>
      <p><font size="2">From Walltown, South Ellerbe Creek flows under Guess 
        Road, the massive surface parking lots at Northgate Mall, and Interstate 
        85. </font></p>

        <font color="#0000CC" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">South 
        Ellerbe emerges from Northgate parking lots and crosses I-85. </font> 
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">South Ellerbe then flows into what was a greenbelt of 
        forests and farms that separated Durham from Braggtown. </font></p>

        <font color="#0000CC" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Playground 
        at Club Blvd Elementary overlooking South Ellerbe. </font> </p>
      <p><font size="2">According to the Durham Architectural and Historic Inventory, 
        rapid growth during the 1940s and 50s, transformed the forests and farmlands 
        into neighborhoods like Northgate Park. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Another branch of South Ellerbe flows north from downtown 
        through Trinity Park -- joining its sister stream near West Club Blvd 
        Elementary. Although many of Trinity Park's early settlers were connected 
        with Trinity College (now Duke), the majority were merchants, businessmen 
        and professionals. In contrast to Durham's late 19th-century neighborhoods 
        like Old West Durham, a smaller proportion of Trinity Park's residents 
        were directly associated with tobacco and textiles. They were part of 
        the broader local economy produced by their families' successes in Durham's 
        leading industries. These younger generations chose not to live in the 
        older neighborhoods where they grew up close to Durham's industries. Highlights 
        along this branch of South Ellerbe include Durham Central Park and the 
        South Ellerbe bike trail.</font></p>

        <font color="#0000CC" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Confluence 
        with Ellerbe Creek (South Ellerbe on left). </font> </p>
      <p><font size="2">From its confluence with Ellerbe Creek, the waters flow 
        to Falls Lake. From there, the Neuse River begins its journey past Raleigh, 
        Smithfield, Goldsboro, Kinston, New Bern, Pamlico Sound and, finally, 
        the Atlantic Ocean. </font></p>

        where Ellerbe Creek flows into Falls Lake (near mouth of Eno River and 
        the I-85 bridge). </font></p>
      <p><font size="2">The path of South Ellerbe Creek is quite a story from 
        its headwaters near Hillsborough Road, passing through history, absorbing 
        some of the city's ills and flowing through forests and farms to the coast.
