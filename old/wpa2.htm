        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">July 7, 1938 </font> 
        </p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Down in Monkey 
          Bottoms in a small four-room house there lives a family of four women, 
          two men, and four children. The house in which they live is typical 
          of the houses in this section of the mill village. Monkey Bottoms begins 
          with a washed-out, hilly road, flanked on one side by closely-placed 
          and disorderly-looking houses and on the other by a jumbled growth of 
          hedge, scrubby trees, and briars. The road leads down into, a bottom 
          and meets at right angles another road of like kind. The houses, of 
          the second road, all located on its right side, maintain the same unlikely 
          appearance. These two roads with their houses comprise Monkey Bottoms. 
          </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the particular 
          house already mentioned Haithcocks, Ways, Fosters, and Piners live in 
          dreary confusion. One small room into which two beds are crowded serves 
          in the daytime as a place for tagging tobacco sacks. The little available 
          floor place is littered with strings and tags. Freida Haithcock and 
          Hulda Foster sit in this room hours at a time, both fortified by a generous 
          quantity of snuff, tagging the tiny sacks and dreaming of the day when 
          they will again have a job in the mill. Together they share a tin can 
          spittoon which is obligingly shifted from one to the other as the need 
          arises. Flies swarm thickly about the poorly screened house and hunt 
          out the bread crumbs scattered by the three oldest children. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The walls give 
          one the impression that some member of the mixed family has made calendar 
          collecting a pastime. Over the mantelpiece enlarged pictures of departed 
          relatives hang crookedly against the wall. On the mantelpiece, the central 
          feature is a large picture entitled "Christ in Gethsemane Praying." 
          On one side of the picture stands a blue and silver tinselled combination 
          with the words, "Book of Life; Is My Name Written There," and on the 
          other, a simply framed assurance, "Jesus Never Fails." </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This household 
          grew around four of Perry Haithcocks' daughters, three of whom are now 
          living. Perry, a tenant farmer, was the father of ten children. Their 
          life on the farm was dull and hard and empty of promise. Perry felt 
          that the cotton mill offered his family a slightly better chance than 
          the farm had ever given. He took his ten children to the mill, and as 
          soon as it would have them he put them to work. Of this crowd none went 
          further than the third grade in school. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The youngest of 
          the Haithcocks, Clara, is now twenty-five. It fell to her lot after 
          her mother's death to stay at home and keep house. When the time arrived 
          for her to go to work there was no job for her. Now a slovenly and disgruntled 
          person, she stays on with the three of her sisters whom circumstances 
          have kept together. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The daughter second 
          to the youngest married Evart Piner and they began housekeeping in Monkey 
          Bottoms. She died at the birth of her first baby, and soon after her 
          death, not quite a year ago, her sister, Effie Way, with her husband 
          and three children came to Evart Piner's house to live. The mill at 
          which they worked had closed with no prospects of reopening in the near 
          future and they hoped to secure work in Durham. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">After weeks of 
          waiting Effie was given a job and she now makes $16 a week. Her husband 
          Tom has not found work yet and his health is such that it is problematical 
          whether he will ever hold a job again. Kidney trouble, high blood pressure, 
          and asthma, make it necessary for him to go to the doctor two or three 
          times monthly. Effie comes home from the mill tired and irritable and 
          she quarrels with her children so much that they have learned to treat 
          with contempt the threats she makes against them. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The fourth sister, 
          Freida, had been living with the Piners before the Ways moved in. Freida 
          has had pneumonia three times and typhoid fever twice. At thirty-six 
          she sits like an old woman, stooped and sallow and wrinkled, as she 
          tags the sacks for which she receives weekly a dollar and a half. Up 
          until a year ago she was a spinner in the mill and drew $15.98 a week. 
          Her health became so bad that she was forced to give up her job. Each 
          time when she goes back now to ask the superintendent to reinstate her 
          he tells her that he is unable to make a place for her. Should he give 
          her work it is doubtful that she could keep it, for she still goes twice 
          a week to Watts Hospital to receive treatment. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Evart Piner, the 
          only member of the household except Effie Way who is working, makes 
          fourteen dollars a week. Out of that he pays board to his sisters-in-law 
          for himself and young baby. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Besides the three 
          sisters Effie Way, Clara and Freida Haithcock, the two brothers-in-law, 
          Clarence Way and Evart Piner, the three Way children and the Piner baby, 
          there is in the same house Hulda Foster. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Hulda was left 
          an orphan at fifteen and she came to live with her neighbors, the Haithcocks. 
          One senses in a little while that to Hulda the household owes whatever 
          semblance of order there may be. At ten she went to work in the Belmont 
          mills and there the rest of her childhood was spent. She tells you how 
          glad she was as a little girl to hear the six o'clock mill whistle in 
          the afternoons because it meant that as soon as she had eaten supper 
          her playtime would begin. The hours from six-thirty until eight-thirty 
          were her own. Tired as she might be from her ten hours of work she was 
          not too tired to join the other children of the neighborhood in their 
          games. As she grew out of childhood there was no form of recreation 
          to take the place of those play hours. The sound of the mill became 
          the one rhythm to which her life was attuned. She says that ever since 
          she has been without a job she has missed the hum of machinery almost 
          as much as she has missed the money with which to buy her food. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Hulda lost her 
          job when the Haw River mill closed. She was then living with the Ways 
          and she moved with them to Durham. A good spinner and a hard worker, 
          she had high hopes of securing a job. A year of unemployment has dimmed 
          her hopes somewhat, but hardship has not yet made her bitter. She sits 
          there, unlettered but not unintelligent, tagging tobacco sacks, while 
          with a quiet concentration she prays for the one thing life has not 
          yet given her -- work. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Even though Hulda 
          is unable to contribute financially to this confused family, one feels 
          that she gives to it something which keeps it from sinking lower than 
          its present depth. There is quiet humor in her eyes as she says "Yes, 
          we eat beans and potatoes and hardboiled cabbage mostly. Most cotton 
          mill folks is a fool about beans but here in this family they aint one 
          of us that cabbage agrees with." She talks on in an effort to keep you 
          from noticing too much the loud, coarse voice of Effie Way who, in the 
          adjoining room, is quarreling with her children. Effie's wrangling makes 
          the house seem dirtier and more confused than before. Hulda and Freida 
          both look at the tin can spittoon and Hulda oblingingly passes it to 
          Freida. After a while Freida speaks in a sickly, whining voice. "Time 
          was when the mill was always needin' hands and a job was no trouble 
          atall to git." Awed a little by the sound of her own voice she looks 
          at Hulda who nods her head in support. In a manner more decisive than 
          Freida's Hulda reaches her hand for another sack. </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">It was about two 
          o'clock in the afternoon and Mary was still busy with her dinner dishes. 
          She asked me to come back to her kitchen, and there I met her oldest 
          daughter, Janie, who was with her mother for a two weeks visit. Mary 
          continued washing dishes while Janie, after rinsing them in a pan of 
          hot water, dried them. The kitchen was clean and orderly and the least 
          disturbing of all the rooms in the house in which to sit. I was glad 
          that Mary after finishing with the dishes did not suggest that we go 
          into another room. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">I had been told 
          that Mary was ill and I expected to find her in bed. When I asked her 
          about her health she replied, "Yes, I'm sick with diabetes most of the 
          time but I try to stay up as much as I can. The doctors at Duke are 
          treating me and I go in twice a week when I'm able. They tell me my 
          body is suffering from the brutish treatment I've give it all my life. 
          If they mean work I reckin I have done as much as the next one." Then 
          Mary told me her story. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Mary Smith was 
          born in Orange County fifty-seven years ago. Her father was a renter 
          and he found it difficult to support his eight children on what was 
          left after the landlord was paid. Not that the children didn't lend 
          a helping hand. Mary cannot remember when she did not contribute her 
          quota of work-hours toward her own support. At six she stood up in a 
          chair to wash the dishes and prepare the scanty meals for cooking while 
          her mother labored in the fields. There were then three smaller children 
          who required the time left over from housekeeping duties. As she grew 
          older there seemed no way to make a little time for school. She thinks 
          that reading must indeed be a great pleasure. Many times she has picked 
          up a book and sat with it in her hands wishing that she might know what 
          was inside its pages. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">When she was eleven 
          the family income was supplemented by group participation in a relatively 
          new industry. Smoking tobacco was gaining in popularity and the manufacturers 
          of the product needed many small bags in which to pack it for distribution. 
          The bag factories which grew up in answer to this need sent the bags 
          out by the thousands into the surrounding countryside to be strung and 
          tagged. During periods of slack in farm work Mary and her young brother 
          walked the five miles into Durham and took back to their home two large 
          sacks, each containing ten thousand small bags. She can remember sitting 
          up all night on occasion during the rush season, each member of the 
          family working as hard as he could to string these sacks for which they 
          received thirty cents a thousand. When sleep laid such a heavy claim 
          on her that she felt she could no longer stand it her mother sent her 
          out on the back porch to dash cold water on her face that she might 
          keep her eyes open yet a little longer. The year she was twelve her 
          skill increased so that she raised the family income by several dollars, 
          and her parents out of appreciation of her industry bought her two percale 
          dresses instead of one. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">By the time she 
          was fifteen years old her father had decided his family would have a 
          better living at a cotton mill than they could ever make for themselves 
          on another man's farm. They sold the mule and the cow but they kept 
          the twenty-six chickens for a while after moving to town. The nice fresh 
          eggs came in handy because wages weren't so high that such things could 
          be bought in plenty. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Mary began work 
          at twenty-five cents a day. Her hours were from six to six but she will 
          tell you that she doesn't believe the twelve hours then were any harder 
          than eight hours now what with the speed-up system they have. Her man 
          Jim comes in clean wore out at the end of a day, but of course she knows 
          he's not a young man any longer. In fact, his working days are almost 
          over because he's not so far from sixty and his body is none too stout. 
          </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">When she married 
          at eighteen she was making four dollars a week and Jim four dollars 
          and a half. If it hadn't been for the installment plan she wonders if 
          they ever could have bought the two beds and stove with which they began 
          housekeeping. Nighttimes Jim made four chairs and a table. With so much 
          furniture in their house they decided to take a couple of boarders to 
          help with the installments still to be paid. The furniture wasn't more 
          than paid for when Mary had to have an operation which cost Jim fifty 
          dollars. That was three momths before her first baby was born and another 
          baby was on its way before the debt was finally paid. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Sometimes when 
          her health was too bad to work in the mill Mary took up her old occupation 
          of stringing bags. The wage had increased to fifty cents a thousand 
          and with steady use of her spare time she could do a thousand a day. 
          In the course of time five children were born to Mary Smith and four 
          of them managed to live past babyhood. Mary's last child was born in 
          1912. It didn't live but three days and the Smiths had to borrow the 
          money to bury it. "That year was one of the hardest in my life," Mary 
          told me that afternoon. "The doctor started comin' to see me in early 
          May and there wasn't a day from then on until the middle of September 
          that he didn't come to our house. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">As soon as I was 
          out of bed Jim took sick with the typhoid fever and for six solid weeks 
          he wasn't able to work. Two of the younguns took the fever from him. 
          If we couldner got credit we woulder starved. It was many a year before 
          we ever caught up again. We was in such bad shape that the two younguns 
          was forced to go in the mill though I'd hoped to keep 'em out until 
          they'd had a little more chance for schoolin'." </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The oldest boy 
          entered the mill at twelve and the oldest girl at thirteen. The boy 
          has been there since except for sick leaves in the past few years when 
          he has been bothered with hemorrhages of the lung. He was such a scrawny, 
          pale, little fellow that many a time when Mary went to rouse him on 
          a cold winter morning she felt like turning away from the bed and letting 
          him rest through the day. But she knew he might lose his job, and the 
          money he made was badly needed. Sometimes now she wonders if his health 
          wouldn't have held out better if she could have kept him out of the 
          mill a few years longer until his body had been given more chance to 
          grow. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This son married 
          after thirty and he has three children, all too young to work, and a 
          wife whose health is so poor she cannot work. He was brought home from 
          the mill with another hemorrhage the other day and Mary is wondering 
          how she can help him. It seems to her that the fourteen dollars a week 
          Jim is making cannot be stretched over another need. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Mary paused at 
          this point in her story and sat with her hands folded in her lap. Janie 
          looked first at her mother and then at me. "If it hadn't been for Mama 
          my younguns wouldner had no clothes atall the past year," she said. 
          "The mill where my husband works aint give its help but four days' work 
          a week in over a year. Tom makes eleven dollars and its all I can do 
          to feed, let along cloths, my crowd on that. "My children is pretty 
          good about not complainin'. They'll set down one day right after another 
          to dried beans and potatoes without raisin' a row. Of course, that oldest 
          one has got all manner of pride and she caused me a sight of trouble 
          for awhile when she had to wear a old coat to school that never fit 
          her nowhere. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"The worst hurt 
          I ever seen her, though, was along 'bout the last of school when her 
          teacher tried to collect rent for the school books she'd been usin' 
          all the year. I thought the State was furnishin' 'em free but they say 
          everybody is supposed to pay rent on 'em. Emma Lee kept after me but 
          I never had the money to give her. One day she broke down in school 
          and cried and told her teacher they wasn't a penny at her home to pay 
          for book rent. The teacher told her to stop worryin' then, and she never 
          bothered her any more. Emma Lee says she's not goin' to stop until she 
          goes clear on through high school." </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Janie's four-year-old 
          child came into the kitchen and propped herself against her grandmother's 
          knee. Mary put her arm about the child and seemed to forget for a while 
          that she was there. "Well, she'll have plenty time to go through high 
          school since the mill can't take 'em until they are sixteen or eighteen, 
          I don't know which," she said. "Of course it's hard to say if things 
          keep on like they are who's goin' to furnish the money. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"It's been a funny 
          thing about my own family," she continued. "Pa didn't have a single 
          child that wasn't willin' to work to try to get ahead and they aint 
          a one of us that's got anything today. They aint never been a time when 
          one was havin' trouble that the others was able to help him out of the 
          bog. They's three of us livin' now. One of my brothers whose wife died 
          last year is gettin' just two day's work a week and him with eight children. 
          I don't know how on earth he's livin'. The other brother is makin' $8 
          a week and he has four children at home. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"This is my pet," 
          Mary continued, changing the subject abruptly as she drew the child 
          closer to her. "She come over a week before her Ma did and I never heard 
          a whimper out of her." </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Is she the next 
          to the youngest?" I asked, addressing Janie. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"No'm, there's 
          two younger than her," Janie answered. "My lap baby is just three months 
          old and the knee baby in yonder room with her is two year old." </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Six children and 
          her thirty-three," Mary said. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"That's more children 
          than a working man can take care of" I ventured. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">A queer sort of 
          smile flitted across Janie's face and she lowered her head. Presently 
          she looked up at me and said slowly, "You are right about that." </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Before I left, 
          all of Janie's children had been in the kitchen. The oldest girl, twelve, 
          looked pale and undernourished. Two of the younger ones played about 
          with a great deal of energy. They would be considered pretty in any 
          average group of children and as I looked across at Janie I wondered 
          how it could be. At thirty-three she is fat, sallow, and unkempt with 
          a look of forty-five at its worst about her face and figure. Good-naturedly 
          she watches her children at play and thinks no further than the next 
          feeding of her small baby. Mary, clean and not unattractive, smiles 
          with patient affection at her daughter and her grandchildren. She has 
          a capacity for thinking ahead that Janie seems not to have. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Mary looks back 
          over her past life and can see in it no period in which she might have 
          saved for the days that are ahead. She will tell you that she has on 
          occasion spent a little money for foolish pleasure but she wonders if 
          a person could stand all the ups and downs of life without giving over 
          now and then to foolish things. Occupying a prominent position on her 
          mantel in the front room is a rose-colored goddess edged in green, propping 
          itself against a green scooped-out tray which serves miscellaneous uses. 
          She bought it for herself at the fair about ten years ago and she's 
          still proud of it. In no less conspicuous places in her front room are 
          framed pictures of the Rock of Ages; Jesus, the Savior; and a bordered 
          motto of her missionary society. A good many of her extra quarters have 
          gone through the channel of the church to help the heathen in foreign 
          lands to a better way of life. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">She faces sixty 
          with assets spent and liabilities yet to be reckoned with. Her chief 
          asset in life has been her capacity for labor and from that, the one 
          material asset she has saved for herself is something like two hundred 
          dollars worth of furniture. The mill can no longer use her and she knows 
          that Jim's days of usefulness are numbered. There has been talk on the 
          hill in recent months about old age benefits. All that Mary understands 
          out of that talk is that when Jim is sixty-five he will begin to draw 
          a little money. She says it isn't reasonable the amount will be enough 
          to keep them both. Actually Jim will draw with interest the 1.5% of 
          his wage saved for him and matched by his employer during his work years 
          beginning with 1936. If his fast-failing health will permit him to serve 
          the mill for two more years he will consider that nothing but luck is 
          carrying him on. He will be sixty-one then with only four more years 
          to go before he starts collecting his old age benefits which with care 
          would last him about six months. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Just before I left 
          Mary's house she looked out of her kitchen window and across the hill. 
          For awhile no one spoke and the hum of the mill was the only sound to 
          be heard in the room. When Mary began to talk it was as if she thought 
          that Janie and I, too, must have been thinking with her on the growth 
          of the mill. "Yonder mill want one-tenth the size it is now when I first 
          come here forty-two year ago," she said. "It seems like me and Jim's 
          got old with the mill but age aint hurt the mill none. When it slows 
          down it can git new parts and we caint. What's worse we soon aint goin' 
          to have money to buy rations for feeding our wore-out bodies. The mill 
          keeps makin' money but it has to give to them that's young and strong, 
          I reckon, and even to them it caint give a regular livin'." </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Mary would like 
          to have a little place of her own on the edge of town where she might 
          raise a garden, and small patches, along with chickens, hogs and a cow 
          -- especially a cow. She knows the country can be hard, bitter hard, 
          because she hasn't forgotten when she was six years old. But then she 
          was working for the other fellow and she believes it would be different 
          if the land and house were hers. Nobody knows better than Mary that 
          such thoughts are but an idle dream. She says that all her life she 
          has known nothing but half-living and she expects no miracle when her 
          days of usefulness are behind her. She does wonder sometimes what kind 
          of a life lies before her children and grandchildren. </font>

        <p> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Sally Dunne is 
          the mother of thirteen children, three of whom are dead and three married. 
          Seven of the children ranging from two and a half to eighteen live with 
          their mother and father in an old, four-room, loosely-built house located 
          a short distance from the houses belonging to the company which owns 
          the mill where John Dunne works. Some of the people in the mill village 
          will tell you that the Dunnes were asked to move off the hill because 
          the near-by neighbors discovered that their coal was disappearing at 
          night; others will tell you that they did not take proper care of the 
          company's house. At any rate the Dunnes cannot rent a company house 
          and they pay $13 a month for the dilapidated one in which they live. 
          It is becoming increasingly difficult for them to find a house of any 
          kind because there have been months when the rent was not paid. John 
          Dunne makes fourteen dollars a week and on that the family of nine must 
          live. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">As you come to 
          the intersection of Broad and C Sts. you will more than likely see Sally's 
          smaller children playing in the little patch of front yard and when 
          you ask them where she is they will answer readily, "Mama, is settin' 
          out on the back porch." One of them runs ahead of you into the house 
          and you walk uneasily through the confusion which is their home. The 
          first two rooms are crowded with dirty beds and a few shabby chairs. 
          The bedroom on the right contains a dusty table and a dustier radio. 
          You look at the dirty floor and your mind is brought back to the fact 
          that the woman who keeps this house is "settin' out on the back porch." 
          </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">You find Sally 
          out there on the small porch surrounded by three of her children who 
          are helping her tag tobacco sacks. Her unwieldy body bulges over the 
          sides of her chair and an enormous tumor gives her the appearance of 
          permanent pregnancy. She tells one of the children to get up and give 
          you his chair. She waits for you to speak and when you have made some 
          introductory remark she says "I keep alookin' toward you but I can't 
          hardly see you. They aint no sight atall in one eye and the sight in 
          the other is gettin' dimmer fast." </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">She speaks of her 
          blindness in a tone of such complete acceptance that you do not know 
          what to say. You look into the dining room at the crude, home-made table 
          with its ugly oilcloth and then at the icebox which is the other piece 
          of furniture in the room. You decide to ask Sally about her work and 
          soon she is telling you that she and the children tag 20,000 of the 
          sacks a week and for it they receive $1.53. "It seems like that money 
          goes further than John's wages," she continues. Sometimes we use it 
          for clothes and now and again we buy somethin' foolish which I reckin 
          we ought to get along without. I buy the "Durham Sun" for the children 
          and it costs 15 a week, but they do love to read the funnies." </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">As Sally goes on 
          to tell you of her early life you decide that even if her eyes were 
          strong the paper she takes for the children would interest her very 
          little as reading matter. She had time to go no further than the third 
          grade, for her public work-life started at ten. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Sally was born 
          in Arkansas on a 160 acre farm belonging to her grandfather, Josiah 
          White. As a young man Josiah was a tenant farmer in Durham County and 
          after he was married he moved to Mississippi, hoping to find there such 
          conditions as would give him a chance to become in time a land-owner. 
          Believing, after two years of hard labor, that possibilities of his 
          becoming a land-owner in that State were remote he moved with his wife 
          and one child into Arkansas. No other children were born to him and 
          by the time his daughter, Molly, mother of Sally, was eighteen he had 
          paid for his 160 acre farm and furnished it with live stock. Molly married 
          a neighboring tenant who then came to live with her on her father's 
          place. When he died eight years later he left Molly with Sally and three 
          younger children. It was not long until Josiah died and his widow, after 
          selling the farm and stock for $1,300, returned to North Carolina. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Near a bag factory 
          in East Durham Molly's mother bought a four-room house for herself and 
          Molly's family. While the grandmother looked after the three smaller 
          children Molly went into the mill. She took Sally, then an energetic 
          child of ten, along and found work for her at twenty-five cents a day. 
          Molly made around fifty cents daily and on the combined wages of mother 
          and child the family subsisted. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Sally had worked 
          a long time before she was sixteen. When she reached that age she felt 
          that life must indeed be half over. Work without any sort of recreation 
          always had been her lot and marriage appeared to offer at least one 
          advantage -- change. Child bearing began immediately and with it even 
          more responsibility and less time for thoughts of recreation. It seems 
          foolish to her today that grown people should want to go to ball games 
          and picture shows. Her dislike of billiard parlors is pronounced but 
          not nearly so much as her fear of liquor stores. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Before she has 
          finished with her remarks about liquor stores it is obvious that John 
          goes to the one just down the street a little too often. "If John was 
          to get drunk and get himself arrested the company would fire him," Sally 
          tells you in affirmation of what you are already thinking. She says 
          that she has not forgotten the two months not more than six years ago 
          when John was out of work and there was not so much as a dollar to buy 
          the children food. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The mill at which 
          John Dunne then worked was closed suddenly but it took the workmen some 
          time to realize that the shut-down could be permanent. After two weeks 
          John started on a trek through North and South Carolina to look for 
          a job. Sally had gotten up early and made bread from the last dust of 
          flour, and fried the last egg. John looked at the table and turned away. 
          "I aint hungry" he said. "I'll leave what's there for the younguns." 
          Sally sat there alone in the kitchen long after he had gone. She knew 
          John was hungry. She knew, too, that his mind was miserable with doubt. 
          He didn't know whether there was any job ahead of him and he didn't 
          know how his family would get food. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Suddenly Sally 
          stops speaking and a smile lights up her ugly face. With an abrupt jesture 
          of her right hand she pushes her hair further up under the bonnet-like 
          cap shading her eyes. Then she says, "We had neighbors close by who 
          was workin' at another mill but my mind wasn't on neighbors that morning 
          John left. I just kept settin' there while the little bit of breakfast 
          got colder and colder. Then all of a sudden I heard a knockin' on the 
          kitchen door. When I opened the door and seen about a dozen folks standin' 
          there with their arms full of groceries I couldn't help but cry. Well, 
          John stayed gone a month and they wasn't a day we didn't have at least 
          one meal. He come back without a job and it was a good month before 
          he got one at another mill in Durham. Them was hard, hard times. I was 
          needin' cover that winter but they wasn't a chance to save ahead for 
          it." </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">You know that any 
          comment you might make would sound trivial. The silence gets deep and 
          is broken only when a young woman you did not know lived here comes 
          out of the house leading her two-year old baby. The child, dressed in 
          a sunsuit, laughs gleefully as her mother puts him out in the yard to 
          play. The woman sits down on a box in the corner of the porch and begins 
          to smoke a cigarette. "That's my daughter Stella," Sally tells you and 
          then adds "Her and her man both is out of work and they're stayin' with 
          us a while." </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Stella is drawn 
          into the conversation and it is not long before she has told you of 
          the furniture she tried to buy. When she and Bill were first married 
          they selected a bedroom suite, a cedar chest, an upholstered chair, 
          two linoleums, and a big fine oil stove. When she first saw the bedroom 
          suite marked at $39.50, she thought it must really be the greatest bargain 
          in town. When, after the sale was made, the proprietor began adding 
          carrying charges which brought the price up to $61 she was a little 
          baffled, but he explained to her just how easy the payments could be 
          made. The bill for the furniture came to $200 and she and Bill had paid 
          all of it but $80 at the time they lost their jobs. She doesn't see 
          yet why they couldn't let her keep at least the bedroom suite. The subject 
          of furniture is soon passed over and Stella tells you why she lost her 
          job. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Stella lost her 
          job when new spinning machinery was installed. The spinners retained 
          were given eight sides instead of seven with a pay increase of two dollars 
          a week. That sum was the regular wage paid heretofore for the operation 
          of one of the old frames. The new Long Draft Machinery has around two 
          hundred spindles and the old spinning frame contained 112 spindles. 
          Stella has a friend still working who says she had never dreamed that 
          eight hours of work could be so hard. Once she was able to catch up 
          with her work and enjoy ten or fifteen-minute rest periods throughout 
          the day, but since the installation of the Long Draft Machinery she 
          stays continuously behind as much as fifteen or twenty minutes. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Stella's husband 
          lost out when the doffers were asked to sign a paper stating that they 
          were willing to do more work. Out of the sixteen then employed eight 
          signed and they immediately began doing the work of all. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Stella and her 
          husband have been living for the past six weeks on the unemployment 
          insurance which they drew and will continue to draw for ten more weeks 
          if their unemployment continues. They have spent a considerable part 
          of it travelling from mill to mill in hope of finding a job. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Stella looks out 
          into the yard where her baby is playing with her young sisters and brothers. 
          "I hope I don't never have another one," she says. "I had a miscarriage 
          from lifting a heavy tub of water when he wasn't more than a year old. 
          I went to the doctor and asked him what a woman could do to keep from 
          havin' babies. I'm tryin' to do what he told me." </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">A child runs through 
          the house and says that he sees his sister, Sue, coming down the street. 
          He leaves the screen door ajar and Stella reprimands him for it though 
          there are plenty of holes through which any fly might find his way inside. 
          </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Sue with her two 
          children arrive and you are told that she is another of Sally's married 
          daughters. She lives with her husband in the near-by mill village. Her 
          hair-style, voice, and mannerisms show a marked resemblance to Betty 
          Boop. You begin to feel that Sally's prejudice against movies is not 
          shared by her children. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Sue's two children, 
          dressed in sunsuits, go out into the yard to play with Stella's baby. 
          The two sisters discuss the amount of milk the doctor has prescribed 
          for their children and indicate by their conversation that they try 
          to meet the requirements. In the meantime you knock at flies. "I declare, 
          I bathe that youngun every night before I put him to bed," Stella is 
          saying "but he does get awful dirty." Sally joins in to say that she 
          dreads Wednesday and Saturday nights because on those two nights all 
          of the smaller children take their bathe and they make a great commotion 
          dragging the tin tub back and forth from the porch to the kitchen where 
          the bathing is done. You look out into the yard at Sally's children 
          and decide that they do appear cleaner than the house to which they 
          belong. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Sue mentions her 
          grandmother, Molly, and when you manifest an interest in her Sally tells 
          you that Molly still lives in the small house which she inherited when 
          her mother died. With her are her unmarried son and her divorced daughter, 
          who is the mother of two children. The son is a loom fixer with a weekly 
          wage of $22.00. He not only supports his mother but also contributes 
          toward the support of his youngest sister's family when her wage as 
          part-time worker in a silk mill cannot meet their needs. Molly's fourth 
          child married a tenant farmer and they have no children. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">After a while you 
          leave the over-crowded house of the Dunnes and as you go along you recall 
          other things that Sally has told you. Into your mind there come certain 
          conclusions as to how she feels toward her own problems. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">With full awareness 
          that her husband's wage can never cover the needs and can hardly touch 
          the wants of her family, she is on the alert for any donations from 
          the outside. She'd like for some of the older children at home to start 
          working in the mill but since the mill cannot use them and the outside 
          world does not need them she has been brought to the attitude that various 
          organizations will have to help her with her problems. Her children 
          had been attending the Methodist Church for a number of years but the 
          kindness of the Baptist preacher at Christmas time last year converted 
          them to the Baptist way of thinking. Sally says "There wouldner been 
          any Christmas at this house if that man hadn't took a interest in providin' 
          for my younguns. He brought a big goods box of things to us and I ain't 
          never been much happier than when I was unpacking it. They was apples, 
          oranges, candy, nuts, tops, dolls, trains, and little wagons -- plenty 
          to divide amongst them still believing in Santa Claus." </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The teacher which 
          she likes best is the one who last winter bought her twelve-year old 
          son a pair of shoes after he had been absent from school for three weeks 
          on account of the cold weather. She hopes that by next year the school 
          will furnish free lunches for the children and eliminate her problem 
          of providing three meals a day. If you should manifest any interest 
          in how she manages to provide food for her crowd, her characteristic 
          answer is, "Every head I've got would go hungry if I didn't keep peas 
          aboilin' in the pot all the time." </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">With continual 
          acceptance of unsolved problems Sally has reached a state of lethargy 
          which she does not or cannot disturb. There seems to be no appreciable 
          effort to train her children in the tasks about the house. After the 
          Dunnes have eaten, some of the children will wash the dishes in a hasty 
          and slip-shod manner and then join the rest of the family in one of 
          the two dirty bedrooms where the $12 radio is turned on at full-blast. 
          Some of the children are good looking and as a group appear of average 
          intelligence. With no direction of their energies they play a little, 
          scrap a little, and live from meal to meal while Sally sits among them, 
          usually holding a tobacco sack which she is tagging without being able 
          to see it very well. </font>
