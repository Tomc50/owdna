        <p>Most home burglars are amateurs looking for easy targets. They're looking 
          for homes which present the least risk of detection; the greatest opportunity 
          for easy access; and the maximum potential for escape. They're looking 
          for homes which appear unoccupied and unprotected; without adequate 
          locks and light; open or unlocked doors and windows; and home sites 
          which provide easy concealment form neighbors and passing motorist which 
          would be the natural users of the neighborhood. To make your home less 
          inviting to a burglar, and to increase the natural surveillance of your 
          home, consider employing some of these effective and inexpensive crime 
          prevention measures. By following these suggestions you can decrease 
          your chances of becoming a victim.</p>
        <p>Survey Your Home</p>
        <p>Look at your home through a burglar's eyes. Does it look like an easy 
          target? Are there obvious security weaknesses?</p>
        <p>1. Shrubbery should not obscure doors and windows. Trim the growth 
          so that a burglar cannot work undetected. </p>
        <p>2. At night leave a few lights burning outside your home. Lights over 
          doorways and garages and strategically placed area lights will make 
          your home less inviting to burglar. Use photo sensors to turn the lights 
          off during the day time hours. </p>
        <p>3. Windows and doors should be securely locked. Inadequate locks should 
          be replaced or supplemented. </p>
        <p>4. Make your home look occupied at all times. Use timer switches on 
          inside lights and appliances (TV &amp; Radio) to give the illusion that 
          your home is occupied. </p>
        <p>5. Security weaknesses around the your home can be identified by a 
          free home inspection by the Durham Police Department.</p>
        <p>Do not open your door to strangers.</p>
        <p> If a stranger asks to use your telephone, offer to make the phone 
          call for them. Do not allow them inside the house. </p>

        <p>What is a Good Lock?</p>
        <p>Crime Prevention experts recommend deadbolt locks to provide the security 
          needed for exterior doors. The bolt should extend at least one inch 
          into the door frame to provide adequate security. There are two basic 
          types of deadbolt locks for residential use. The double cylinder and 
          the single cylinder deadbolt lock. A double-cylinder deadbolt with a 
          1" throw is the best lock you can buy, provided you have a solid-core 
          door. This is recommended because it is very sturdy and difficult to 
          open without a key on either side. When the house is occupied, a key 
          should be left in the keyhole or a convenient location as a means of 
          fast exit in case of a fire. Always remove the key when leaving home. 
          The striker plate should be secured to the door jamb with three inch 
          long screws. For maximun security, consider installing a heavy duty 
          striker plate which has four mounting screws. If a burglar breaks in 
          another way, such as a window, don't provide an easy point of exit through 
          the door. The more trouble they have getting out, the less they will 
          be able to carry away with him. Sticks, bars (Charlie Bars) and broom 
          handles in the tracks of sliding glass doors provide some protection, 
          but they can be removed. Burglars can still pry silding glass doors 
          open and lift it out of its frame. Sliding glass doors can be pinned 
          for extra security. Remember to secure your locks at all times to reduce 
          chances of you becoming a victim. Do not hide a key under a mat, beneath 
          a flowerpot or on a near by window sill. These places are well known 
          by the burglars. The best place to secure a key outside the home, is 
          with a trusted neighbor.</p>
        <p>If a burglar can't easily get through a door, they may well try a window. 
          Proper home security should take this fact into account. While most 
          burglars avoid breaking glass due to the fear of attracting attention, 
          they usually try to pry open windows. There are many inexpensive products 
          on the market for prevention of this type of entry:</p>
        <p>1. Double-hung windows latches may be jimmied, or pried open. Drill 
          a downward hole into the top of the bottom window and into the bottom 
          of the top window. Insert a pin or nail that can be removed in case 
          of fire. </p>
        <p>2. With sliding windows, the primary objective is to keep the window 
          from sliding or being lifted up and out of the track. Pins, anti-slide 
          blocks and slide bolts are effective methods of deterrence. Check with 
          a hardware dealer for advice. </p>
        <p>3. Louvered windows can be better secured by removing the crank. Again 
          keep the crang in a convenient location for fire safety.</p>
        <p>If you would like to schedule a home security survey, please contact 
          the substation.</p>
