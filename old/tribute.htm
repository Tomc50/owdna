          a lot of people around here, I'm a transplant. In fact until very recently 
          I considered myself a transient: from somewhere else and on my way to 
          somewhere else as soon as this grad-school, first-job phase of my life 
          was over. I used to think North Carolina was a nice place to go to school 
          but no place for this west-coast girl to settle down. I just didn't 
          feel at home here: it was too humid, too flat, and too Jesse. </FONT></font></font></font></p>
        <FONT SIZE=3><FONT SIZE=2><FONT COLOR=black> 
        <P> 
        <P> Then I moved to this little neighborhood called Old West Durham. It's 
          nothing fancy, just some simple (but very cool) homes that border Duke's 
          East campus, around the Ninth Street area. Here I found this amazing 
          thing - real community. Folks stop while on walks to chat to each other 
          and go out of their way to help neighbors out. I even get compliments 
          on my efforts to spruce up my flower beds (a gardener I am not...but 
          I do try occasionally), and as for cat care when we go away, there's 
          always someone willing to feed and visit 'em. 
        <P> 
        <P> And there's this group - Old West Durham Neighborhood Association 
          - to which we all can belong: renters, owners, long time residents and 
          short timers. We meet every month and discuss issues important to us. 
          And guess what? We can affect our quality of life - we can get streetlights 
          so folks feel a little safer walking at night; we can get a 4-way stop 
          sign at a busy intersection, to make it a little easier for us to cross 
          a busy street. We've also done a good deed or two, like collecting food 
          to donate to local shelters, and organizing a neighborhood clean-up 
          day. And of course we chat and get to know and appreciate each other. 
          This is small stuff, but in these days of long commutes and longer work 
          hours, I think it's all the more important to foster strong ties with 
          our neighbors. It helps us to gain a sense of community and a stronger 
          sense of self. 
        <P> 
        <p> Take something as simple as a neighborhood sign that says Old West 
          Durham. We unveiled it a few weeks ago on the island at the corner of 
          Ninth St. and Hillsborough Rd. While it took a lot of work and perseverance 
          to make it happen, the end result is simple and elegant and goes a long 
          way toward building community. It just states who we are, and what we 
          believe.<br>

        - to me this is home. And I don't feel too much like a displaced Californian 
        anymore. I've learned to sweat in the summer, to drive to the beach and 
        the mountains when I feel the need, and to take pride in voting for what 
        I believe in. And I do go out west often. But then I come home - to Old 
        West Durham. </FONT>

          the key to economic recovery: The Triangle ranks sixth in the nation 
          for its 'creative class'</font></b> <br>
          (Independent Weekly, September 2002)</p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Sitting in the 
          basement caf&eacute; of the Regulator Bookshop in Durham, Rose-May Guignard 
          explains why she wants to move to the Triangle as soon as she can. She's 
          in town for the weekend visiting friends, which she's been doing as 
          much as possible. There's a buzz of energy in the room, and it's coming 
          from her. Young, single, about to finish her Ph.D. in Public Affairs 
          and Public Administration at Virginia Tech, she's ready to settle in 
          a place full of cool people who are taking risks with their lives. "At 

          a party, someone asked me, 'So are you one of those people who's going 
          to find a job and go wherever your job takes you?' I said, 'No, I've 
          made up my mind. I want to move here.' And they gave me that quizzical 
          look and said, 'Why?' I said, 'You know, it's that concentration of 
          educated people that I can go and have an intelligent conversation with.' 
          For me what made Durham so interesting is that here I meet so many people 
          that are not just talking about what they're going to do, they're trying 
          it out. That's exciting to be in a place where people are like that."</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Guignard is just 
          one of a growing group of people who are building their lives around 
          the city they want to live in. She is a member of what author Richard 
          Florida calls the "creative class," a group defined not by income level 
          but by one common quality: creativity. In his provocative book, The 
          Rise of the Creative Class: And How It's Transforming Work, Leisure, 
          Community and Everyday Life, Florida, a professor of regional economic 
          development at Carnegie Mellon University, lays out who this group is 
          and why they drive the new economy by creating new ideas, inventions, 
          patents, and technology. Florida rates the Triangle as one of the top 
          ten creative centers in the country. That means SAS software developers, 
          Sierra Club organizers, Duke professors, graduate students, self-employed 
          consultants, indie rockers, lawyers, biotech researchers--basically, 
          anyone who has the luxury of thinking for a living--is taking part in 
          the cultural shift. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Since its release 
          this spring, the book has gotten a lot of buzz--far more than the typical 
          book on regional economic development. An excerpt ran as the cover story 
          of the May issue of the Washington Monthly with the headline, "Why cities 
          without gays and rock bands are losing the economic development race." 
          The book sends an emphatic message to cities: Keep your historic buildings 
          occupied and your downtowns thriving. Treat your artists and rock bands 
          with some respect; they draw economic prosperity. And stop spending 
          all that tax money on sports stadiums and shopping malls, it's not what 
          brings the people you want. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Most provocative 
          is the thesis that cities without a thriving gay scene are likely to 
          lose out economically. In charting his research on creative centers, 
          Florida found that it correlated almost exactly with a colleague's research 
          on gay centers. He calls gays and lesbians "the canaries of the new 
          economy"--their presence is an indication of the tolerance that draws 
          other non-traditional creative types. And he lumps all "creatives" together, 
          from starving artists to six-figure earning engineers, asserting that 
          anyone generating new ideas or inventions spurs economic growth. "You 
          can't have high-tech innovation without art and music," he writes. "All 
          forms of creativity feed off each other."</font></p>
