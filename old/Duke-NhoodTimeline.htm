		<p><strong>February 2003:</strong> 18 representatives of the twelve Duke-Durham
		  partnership neighborhoods meet at Duke offices in the Erwin Mill building.
		  Duke architect tells assembled that the Durham community hasn't cared
		  what Duke has done for 75 years, why should they start now?</p>
		<p><strong>March
		  2003:</strong> Durham Planning Director, Frank Duke, 
		  sends the partnership neighborhoods representatives the following email...</p>
		<p>&quot;At the moment [the Univ-College ordinance] does retain the language 
		  I showed the neighborhoods and Duke. Duke is actively lobbying to change 
		  it. They want to change the next to last sentence of the permitted uses 
		  section to read:</p>
		<p>&quot;&quot;Retail uses, such as university-related bookstores and 
		  dining facilities located within other buildings, shall be permitted, 
		  to the extent that they are designed to serve the campus population 
		  of the university and not to attract additional traffic to the campus.&quot;&quot;</p>
		<p>&quot;This proposes to delete the qualifiers of &quot;limited&quot; 
		  retail and &quot;on-&quot;campus population. The effect of these changes 
		  would be that any retail designed to serve a population between the 
		  ages of 18 and 65 would be a permitted use.&quot;</p>
		<p>&quot;In effect, Duke is requesting the language be changed to permit 
		  a Streets of Southpoint as a permitted use on the campus.&quot;</p>
		<p><strong>March 2003:</strong> Watts-Hillandale president (reflecting 
		  the concerns of many neighborhoods) writes to Duke President Nan Keohane...</p>
		<p>&quot;I am now disappointed to learn that Duke University is asking 
		  the city for a significant change to the proposed ordinance without 
		  first informing the other stakeholders. If Duke was dissatisfied with 
		  the revised version of the proposed ordinance, Duke's representatives 
		  should have made the university's objections known to the Planning Department 
		  and the neighborhoods during the meetings which were set up for the 
		  purpose of airing such concerns.&quot;</p>
		<p>&quot;The change that Duke is now seeking, the elimination of limits 
		  on commercial uses within areas to be zoned UC, runs to the very heart 
		  of the ordinance and was the subject of the principal debate among the 
		  stakeholders. To permit the neighborhoods and the Planning Department 
		  to rise from the meeting table with the impression that Duke was content 
		  with the parties' compromise seems more than a little unfair. This is 
		  especially troublesome considering that Duke hosted the meetings in 
		  its own offices. Quite frankly, I feel as though Duke has dealt with 
		  us in something less than good faith. In the spirit of compromise, Watts 
		  Hospital-Hillandale agreed to forgo a number of things we wished to 
		  see included in the new UC ordinance. Evidently, Duke did not enter 
		  into the discussions motivated by that same spirit.&quot;</p>
		<p><strong>Spring 2003:</strong> Senior VP John Burness tries to mislead 
		  a reporter by saying what exacerbated tensions with the neighborhoods 
		  was City staff sharing information with residents. In fact, what exacerbated 
		  these tensions was the Duke Architect going behind our back to remove 
		  &quot;limited retail&quot; from the local ordinance. Duke's attempt 
		  to shift the blame from their own actions to City staff is not appreciated.</p>
		<p><strong>Spring 2003:</strong> Duke senior VP Tallman Trask states in 
		  the newspaper that someone told the neighborhoods Duke wanted three 
		  big box retail stores in a row. In fact, no one said this to us. Does 
		  Duke make such public erroneous assertions to make the neighborhoods 
		  look alarmist and uninformed? Although such calculated statements are 
		  not appreciated, it is hard to blame neighborhood residents for being 
		  suspicious when Duke goes behind closed doors and tries to effect changes 
		  in the local ordinance.</p>
		<p><strong>April 2003:</strong> After President Keohane receives dozens 
		  of emails opposing on-campus retail beyond the school's academic mission 
		  from the community, Duke pulls Central Campus from the new Univ-College 
		  district shortly before a City Council meeting held on April 7.</p>
		<a name="retail" id="retail"></a>
        <p><strong>Spring 2003:</strong> Representing the partnership neighborhoods, 
          Old West Durham president John Schelp and Tallman Trask work out Central 
          Campus retail agreement (ie. three small restaurants, 99-room hotel 
          with restaurant, university bookstore with coffee shop, store selling 
          Duke clothes &amp; accessories, bowling alley, performing arts center, 
          and dorms). </p>
        <p><strong>Spring 2003</strong>: Schelp presents agreement to representatives 
          of partnership neighborhoods at one of their many meetings in the Northgate 
          Mall conference room. Neighborhood representatives discuss and vote 
          to endorse the agreement. On-campus retail agreement is documented in 
          letters to Nan Keohane and other Duke leaders, N&amp;O, and the Herald-Sun.</p>
        <p><strong>Summer 2003:</strong> Duke-Durham partnership neighborhoods 
          speak in support of Duke's rezoning plans for East Campus, West Campus 
          and the Medical Center before the Zoning Committee, Planning Commission, 
          and City Council. Measure passes unanimously. Duke officials repeatedly 
          promise to tell the partnership neighborhoods when the Central Campus 
          plans were ready. </p>
        <p><strong>December 2003:</strong> Chance encounter with Duke VP for capital 
          assets at Elmo's Diner discloses that Central Campus plans are ready. 
          When approached by neighborhood representatives asking to see the plans, 
          more senior officials quickly change their tune, saying plans will be 
          ready in January, then February, then March. During this delay, Duke 
          officials meet with City officials to go over their plans.</p>
        <p><strong>March 2004:</strong> After months of accusing partnership neighborhoods 
          reps of spreading &quot;rumors&quot; about Duke's on-campus retail plans, 
          Tallman Trask states at a public forum in Trinity Heights that Duke 
          is considering &quot;general commercial&quot; zoning category (ie. unlimited 
          retail) for Central Campus. This action is consistent with Duke's efforts 
          a year ago to remove &quot;limited retail&quot; from the ordinance and 
          again produces tensions with tensions with partnership neighborhoods. 
          Duke officials assure forum participants they will do better communicating 
          Duke's plans for Central Campus.</p>
        <p><strong>March 2004:</strong> Duke officials start inviting new presidents 
          of partnership neighborhoods to meetings. The exclusion of those with 
          whom Duke had been negotiating Central Campus plans for months from 
          this meeting raises suspicions that Duke is trying to foster divisions 
          between the partnership neighborhoods they say they want to help.</p>
        <p><strong>April 2004: </strong>John Hope Franklin Center hosts campus 
          forum asking whether Duke is isolating itself from Durham. Several students, 
          faculty and community reps state that a self-contained retail area on 
          campus would isolate Duke from Durham. Public Affairs rep says Duke 
          &quot;only wants 10,000 extra sq feet.&quot; This extra retail represents 
          a violation of our agreement and is inconsistent with Mr. Trask's recent 
          comments that he couldn't say how much retail Duke wanted to build. 
          Moreover, if Duke succeeds in obtaining a general commercial zoning, 
          which allows for unlimited retail, there is nothing that would limit 
          Duke to 10,000 sq feet of additional retail.</p>
        <p><strong>April 2004:</strong> Herald-Sun editorial says Duke has raised 
          &quot;justifiable ire&quot; with its plans for Central Campus and needs 
          to win back the neighborhood's trust.</p>
        <p><strong>June 2004</strong>: The InterNeighborhood Council of Durham 
          voted to endorse a statement saying INC &quot;supports the position 
          that the new University-College District is the most appropriate zoning 
          designation for Duke's Central Campus. The INC also supports the list 
          of limited retail uses that was worked out with Duke and endorsed by 
          the partnership neighborhoods in 2003.&quot;</p>
        <p>Despite the efforts of a Duke official at the meeting to have the last 
          sentence of the INC statement removed, the measure was passed overwhelmingly.</p>
        <p><strong>December 2004:</strong> Despite assurances at the March forum 
          to better communicate its Central Campus plans with the neighborhoods, 
          we've heard nothing from Duke. We then read in the Duke Chronicle (11/29/04) 
          that Duke's Board of Trustees was set to approve proposals for Central 
          Campus. Duke officials insist the article was wrong. Duke could have 
          set the record straight. One thing this episode shows is that Duke doesn't 
          yet get that they need to be proactive in contacting and sharing information 
          with its partnership neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>The fact remains that, despite their assurances to better communicate 
          with the partnership neighborhoods, we hadn't heard a word from Duke 
          over nine months.</p>
        <p><strong>February 2005:</strong> Duke holds a meeting and has less to 
          report than its March 2004 meeting. Partnership neighborhoods ask to 
          participate on Duke's planning committees but Duke officials do not 
          respond.</p>
        <p><strong>April 2005: </strong>Duke's VP for Public Affairs is guilty
          of intentional deception by saying on community listserves that Duke's
          Provost &quot;scoffed&quot; at idea of car wash when talking with reporter.
          In fact, the Provost's 3/15/05 memo to Duke's Academic Council listed
          a car wash on page 2. Provost told the reporter he wouldn't rule anything
          out of the memo. Duke's PR office then ignores memo and attacks neighborhood
          president for the &quot;rather silly idea of a car wash&quot; -- suggesting
          we check first with PR staff to avoid inaccurate rumors and inaccurate
          reports. Duke quietly omits table listing the &quot;car wash&quot; when
          posting the Central Campus reports on Duke website. </p>
        <p><strong>May 2005:</strong> Timeline on Duke's new Central Campus website
          ignores February 2003 meeting (initiated by Duke) with 18 representatives
          of 12 partnership neighborhoods to talk about campus land use plans
          where the community first raised concerns about Central Campus and
          retail. Duke's timeline ignores the many, many months of meetings among
          the partnership neighborhoods in 2003 -- and ignores the significant
          role played by partnership neighborhoods to support the re-zoning for
          East and West campuses and the Medical Center.</p>
        <p><strong>May 2005:</strong> After calling the campus retail area &quot;Main
          Street,&quot; Duke officials then start calling it a &quot;University
          Village.&quot; In constant spin control, school officials now start
          calling the area an &quot;Academic Village.&quot;</p>
        <p><strong>May 2005:</strong> Duke officials finally commit to University/College zoning for Central Campus, something we in the neighborhoods have been asking for all along. Stakeholders look forward to seeing the Development Plans to see how Duke officials have addressed the numerous issues raised by different community groups. Neighbors and merchants are also looking forward to seeing the university's plans for &quot;Limited retail uses, such as university-related bookstores and dining facilities located within other buildings, shall be permitted, to the extent that they are designed to serve the on-campus population of the university and not to attract additional traffic to the campus&quot; (UDO text). </p>
        <p><strong>May 2006:</strong> After three and a half years of Duke assurances that Central Campus redevelopment would not undermine nearby business districts, the university submits a mostly blank Development Plan. In doing so, Duke officials have virtually ignored the concerns raised during dozens of discussions with community groups. Duke's nearly blank Development Plan leaves the impression that all those &quot;community meetings&quot;<br />
          were nothing but window dressing.</p>
        <p><strong>Summer 2006:</strong> Stakeholders hold a series of meetings and ask Duke to place a square footage cap on their campus retail. </p>
        <p><strong>Summer 2006:</strong> When stakeholders ask to meet with Duke officials before the Planning Commission hearing, the university's initial response was that such a meeting wasn't necessary since there was nothing to discuss. </p>
        <p><strong>Oct 2006:</strong> One week before the Planning Commission vote, Duke finally submits committed elements. Their retail element would allow any number of 1/2 acre stores. Since Duke pays no property taxes on such revenue-generating enterprises, this arrangement pre-empts important revenue for local schools, libraries and social services.</p>
        <p><strong>Oct 2006:</strong> Duke refuses request to cap campus retail.<br />
          Stakeholders ask City-County Planning Commission to vote against Duke's rezoning request.</p>
        <p><strong>Oct 2006:</strong> Durham Planning Commission votes to reject Duke's rezoning application. </p>
        <p><strong>Oct 2006:</strong> Shortly after getting voted down, Duke President Richard Brodhead tells senior university officials to stop worrying -- Duke has enough votes on City Council. </p>
        <p><strong>Oct 2006:</strong> Herald-Sun reports that Duke proposes sweetheart deal -- where Durham gets $2 million dollars  from the university in exchange for &quot;any other necessary approvals&quot; related to Anderson Street, which happens to go through the very heart of Central Campus.</p>
        <p><strong>Oct 2006:</strong> Stakeholders learn from Council members that Duke does not have the votes. Work continues toward a solution that both sides can support.</p>
		<p><strong>Jan  2007:</strong> Stakeholders and Duke officials work out binding committed elements on  all twelve issues and walk into City Council chambers with an agreement. Highlights  include a cap on campus retail, saving the old mill houses, limiting building  heights along Erwin Road,  protecting more stream bed areas and setting aside more green-space than called  for in the ordinance.</p>
		<p>On  the Duke side, much of the credit goes to Provost Peter Lange.  In the end, we all have a vested interest in the successful redevelopment of  Central Campus -- and in healthy businesses and neighborhoods in Durham.</p>
