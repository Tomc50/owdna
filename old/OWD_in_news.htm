Students in 49 states,  the West indies and Africa have participated  in the effort, according to the council.</font></p>

      (News &amp; Observer, 31 January 2006)</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">This city's faithful --  similar to proud New Yorkers who would live nowhere else -- boast about the  gritty, urban neighborhoods... &quot;I've lived here 30 years. You wouldn't  catch me anyplace else,&quot; said Carol Anderson,  an owner of Vaguely Reminiscent, a granola-chic clothing and gift shop on Ninth Street.  &quot;Durham is  the best without question. We've got problems like you have anywhere else. It's  just whether you try to face them, and I think we do.&quot;</font></p>

        (Duke Chronicle, 24 January  2006)</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">One reason administrators  have cited in the past regarding the difficulty in expanding the DukeCard  program is the University's tax-exempt status as a non-profit institution...  When Duke students order food at Duke or through Merchants on Points, they do  not pay sales tax.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">&quot;If Duke  is buying something as an institution it's one thing, but individuals buying a  pizza or something is another,&quot; said Tom Campbell,  co-owner of The Regulator Bookshop on Ninth    Street. &quot;It should be looked at in fairness  to everyone else in this community that pays sales tax.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><strong>'DukeCard' ruling on hold</strong><br>
        (Herald-Sun, 29 January  2006)</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Duke still has made no decision  on a request last fall to allow students to use their university spending  accounts for purchases off campus... At other universities, however, the  arrangement is common. And it is much less costly than the 18 percent commission  Duke charges in its program that is now limited to restaurant deliveries to  campus...</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">On Durham's Ninth Street, Tom Campbell,  co-owner of The Regulator Bookshop, said... &quot;My assumption has been that  it's a choice Duke has made to keep all its  transactions on campus.&quot; </font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><strong>Letter: DukeCard questioned</strong><br>
        (Herald-Sun, 12 December  2005)<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        The Duke Chronicle quoted  Duke students saying they seldom patronize off-campus businesses because they  prefer the convenience of making purchases with DukeCards rather than cash...  Expanding the DukeCard program along the UNC One Card model would encourage  more students to venture off campus and patronize Durham businesses. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><strong>Letter: Duke a non-profit?</strong><br>
        (Herald-Sun, 16 December  2005) <br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        The Oct. 28 Duke Chronicle  reported that DukeCard purchases are tax-exempt, and therefore must be  conducted on campus... Duke gets these tax breaks  because it's a &quot;non-profit,&quot; but this looks a whole lot like  &quot;for-profit&quot; behavior. I just don't see other non-profits engaging in  such elaborate schemes to avoid paying sales tax. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><strong>Letter: Much confusion over  DukeCard taxation issue</strong> (Herald-Sun, 2 January 2006)</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Whichever way you cut it,  somebody at Duke &quot;misinformed&quot; me... it demonstrates how frustrating  it can be to deal with Duke's administration. It's time for some straight  answers. They have heard our concerns, and told us that they'd get back to us  with the details in a month. It's now been well over two months. So, we're all  waiting for a comprehensive statement regarding the DukeCard and sales tax.  Once that's straightened out, we can move on to the next DukeCard question: Why  is Duke skimming off 18 percent from each purchase,  when other universities are only charging 2-3 percent? </font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><strong>Letter: With its cards, Duke acts like Donald Trump <br>
        </strong>(Herald-Sun, 5 February 2006)<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Duke, which is considerably  more well endowed than [most] institutions, apparently gouges both their  students and the local merchants while accepting the two-fold subsidy we  taxpayers give them as an educational institution: Tax breaks for donors to the  university and a pass on the payment of property and sales taxes... Looks like  they want it both ways: To be considered needy, do-gooder education providers  when it comes to claiming a public subsidy, while playing aggressive, private  sector-style entrepreneurs when it comes to economic relations with the  surrounding town. </font></p>

        (Duke Chronicle, 17 January  2006)</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Eighteen percent of our  points spent at Durham  businesses will be recycled back into Duke (a total of $540,000 per year),  according to Wulforst...<br>
        Considering that a  confidential Auxiliary Services budget presentation put all parking ticket  revenues at $600,000 in 2000, it&rsquo;s surprising that this tariff doesn&rsquo;t earn  more ire from the students... it is far worse to keep the surrounding business  in Durham at their current disadvantage and to continue to deny them business  from Duke students.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><strong>Column: Town-Gown on Points</strong><br>
        (Duke   Towerview magazine, February 2006)<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        In the Princeton Review's  2005 student survey of college rankings, Duke's town-gown relations were fifth  worst in the nation. Duke officials may dismiss them as unscientific, but these  ratings raise questions about how students form such negative perceptions of  town-gown relations and how Duke might counter them...  Lowering DukeCard start-up costs and commissions would improve town-gown  relations, enabling more small, local businesses -- like Blue Corn Caf&eacute; or the  Regulator on Ninth Street  or Morgan Imports at Brightleaf -- to participate in the program... Supporting  locally owned merchants is another important way Duke  could help the local economy and tax base. </font></p>

As recently as 20 years ago, many Durham residents relied on textile mills for their livelihoods...

Still visible are some remains of Erwin Cotton Mills, which closed nearly 94 years after they were incorporated by Benjamin Duke of Durham's well-known Dukes. Tourists might be drawn to old brick mill buildings transformed into offices and apartments. They also might drive or stroll past surviving mill houses that still line Durham streets. </font></p>

        dollars on which they pay no taxes. </font></p>

        to fund businesses that compete with the local economy, serve the mission

        which have ignited controversy within the Durham neighborhoods that
        border
        campus -- make it seem like Duke's vision of 'the real world'
        was something like The Streets at Southpoint... While more shopping
        venues would be attractive to undergraduates, this vision does not
        truly foster a diverse academic and cultural exchange with the 'real

      <p><font size="2">We give tax-exempt status to educational institutions
        precisely to support their academic mission, and to ease financial
        pressure so that
        they can focus on that mission, since an educated citizenry is in everyone's
        interest. So why should we allow these advantaged dollars, that come
        at the expense of a community full of increasing needs and increasingly
        desperate for revenue sources, to be used to compete with local business?
        What about a fiduciary responsibility for citizens to see that all
        members of a community contribute their fair share to society's overhead?
        I'm afraid the answer to those questions could be that Duke has better
        lawyers, a public relations team (read: spin doctors) and enough sheer
        influence to get away with it -- the might-makes-right, 800-pound gorilla
        scenario... One would hope that the educational mission of Duke would
        include teaching by example. </font></p>

        from the hill west of Ninth Street. With the mill as the chief source
        
        of employment for nearly a century, the neighborhood was working class
        and the stores on Ninth Street reflected it: McDonald's drug store,
        
        White Star laundry, numerous small grocery stores and, of course, Biscuit
        King. In 1986, the mill closed and the neighborhood's economy collapsed.

        was closing itself off from the community in the name of security. &quot;At

        at  the end of its patience with Duke University over development
        issues, 
        and that's too bad for both parties. Old West Durham president John
        Schelp said last week Duke is more interested in what it wants to
        do 
        than in fostering a true partnership with adjacent neighborhoods...
        Duke has raised justifiable ire within the Old West Durham group
        with 
        its plans for rebuilding Central Campus, including more space for retail
        than Old West Durham says it agreed to. Schelp and others fear that
        
        too much tax-exempt retail in Central Campus would affect Ninth Street,
        Brightleaf Square and even Northgate Mall. These are legitimate
        concerns... 
        Duke for its part needs to compromise with Old West Durham to the fullest
        extent possible, and win back the neighborhood's trust. </font></p>

        of sexual assault each year, she said, and generally only one report
        
        involves an attack from a stranger. Although trying to prevent stranger
        rape is important, Lisker said, women students should not ignore
