		<p><strong>Town-Gown On Points</strong><br />
		  by John Schelp and Carol   Anderson<br />
	    Duke Towerview  magazine (February 2006)</p>
		<p>In the Princeton Review&rsquo;s 2005 student survey of college  rankings, Duke&rsquo;s town-gown relations were fifth worst in the nation. Duke  officials may dismiss them as unscientific, but these ratings raise questions  about how students form such negative perceptions of town-gown relations and  how Duke might counter them. </p>
		<p>When the Old West Durham Neighborhood Association  investigated poor student attendance at a Duke-sponsored Block Party on Ninth Street last  fall, it found that changing DukeCard policies could counter these perceptions.  Current DukeCard policies prohibit students from using the card for purchases  off-campus, discouraging them from patronizing local merchants. For small,  locally owned merchants, the costs associated with the program ($1,500 to $3,500  start-up costs and 18% commissions) make participation prohibitively expensive.</p>
		<p>Many other universities have programs that enable student  IDs to function like debit cards by linking them to area bank accounts. Both  UNC-Chapel Hill and NC State allow students to use their cards off campus. NCSU  charges no commissions. Instead of dragging their feet, senior administrators  like Tallman Trask  and Kemel Dawkins should implement DukeCard policies  that would encourage students to venture off campus, benefit both the Duke and Durham communities, and  improve perceptions of town-gown relations. </p>
		<p>In a Chronicle article, Duke officials attributed limiting  DukeCard use to on-campus purchases to the University&rsquo;s tax-exempt status. But  as a local business owner pointed out in a recent Chronicle article (1/24/06),  there&rsquo;s a big difference between the University&rsquo;s purchases being exempt from  sales taxes and individual DukeCard purchases of pizza or sandwiches being  tax-exempt. Bluntly stated, this difference is fairness. </p>
		<p>Current DukeCard policies unfairly discourage Duke students  and employees from venturing off campus to purchase food, textbooks, or other  items, depriving Durham and North Carolina of sales tax revenues and  placing this burden on the backs of local residents and businesses. Surely this  is not the reason we grant tax-exempt status to institutions of higher  learning. And it may surprise Blue Devil parents that Duke&rsquo;s dubious use of its  tax-exempt status is compounded by its 18% bite from every pizza-on-points  delivered to their student&rsquo;s dorm. </p>
		<p>Lowering DukeCard start-up costs and commissions would  improve town-gown relations, enabling more small, local businesses &mdash; like Blue  Corn Caf&eacute; or the Regulator bookstore on Ninth Street or Morgan Imports at Brightleaf  &mdash; to participate in the program. Duke&rsquo;s current high set-up fees and 18%  commissions are more easily absorbed by national chains than small, local  merchants. And supporting locally owned merchants is another important way Duke could help the local economy and tax base. </p>
		<p>In April 2005, Publisher&rsquo;s Weekly reported an Austin, Texas study that  found $45 of every $100 spent at an independent Austin  bookseller stayed in the local community, while just $13 of every $100 spent at  the national chain Borders stayed in the community, making the independent  bookseller&rsquo;s contribution to the local economy nearly three times higher than  the national chain&rsquo;s. It is reasonable to think that what holds for booksellers  also holds for restaurants, music sellers, and boutiques. </p>
		<p>Thus, both DukeCard holders and Durham will benefit from  thriving local business districts with locally owned merchants frequented by  Duke students and staff &mdash; the former by a wider array of dining, shopping, and  entertainment choices and more contact with the Durham community and the latter  by new customers and increased tax revenues in the local community. </p>

		<p><strong>Letter: DukeCard questioned</strong><br />
	    Herald-Sun, 12 December 2005 </p>
		<p>After a poorly attended 9th Street block party Duke sponsored  during student orientation, the Old West Durham Neighborhood Association  received feedback from merchants suggesting that DukeCard policies contributed  to the poor turnout. The DukeCard allows students to use the card rather than  cash for purchases, but only for purchases on the Duke campus. </p>
		<p>We asked Duke officials if the system could be changed to  allow DukeCard use for off-campus purchases. We also asked if Duke  could reduce both start-up costs for merchants (currently $1,200-$3,500) and  its commissions on purchases (currently around 18 percent), high costs that  make program participation prohibitive for many local businesses. </p>
		<p>President Richard   Brodhead's initial response was  encouraging and Duke officials promised a timely response. But the semester's  end and the holiday season are here, and we're still waiting. </p>
		<p>In the meantime, we learned that Indiana University  charges local merchants $300 in set-up costs and 3-5 percent in commissions. We  also learned that UNC One Cards can be linked to an area bank account and used  as check-cards at off-campus businesses -- a model Duke  should consider. </p>
		<p>The Duke Chronicle quoted Duke students saying they seldom  patronize off-campus businesses because they prefer the convenience of making  purchases with DukeCards rather than cash. </p>
		<p>Duke officials have repeatedly said they support business  districts near campus. Expanding the DukeCard program along the UNC One Card  model would encourage more students to venture off campus and patronize Durham businesses. </p>
		<p>And cutting DukeCard set-up and commission costs would be a  way for Duke to put its money where its mouth is.</p>

		<p><strong>Letter: Duke a non-profit?</strong><br />
	    Herald-Sun, 16 December 2005 </p>
		<p>An earlier letter to The Herald-Sun questioned Duke for its slow response in expanding the DukeCard system  to off-campus merchants [see above]. I'd like to think that the delay is just  the byproduct of a lethargic Duke bureaucracy, but it seems there may be more  than that. </p>
		<p>The Oct. 28 Duke Chronicle reported that DukeCard purchases  are tax-exempt, and therefore must be conducted on campus. So, one of the pizza  chains would deliver a pizza to a dorm, accept the DukeCard as payment, and Durham gets no sales tax.  All the while, Duke takes an 18 percent slice for  itself, and the card can't be used off-campus. Thanks Duke! Way to help the  community! </p>
		<p>Duke gets these tax breaks  because it's a &quot;non-profit,&quot; but this looks a whole lot like  &quot;for-profit&quot; behavior. I just don't see other non-profits engaging in  such elaborate schemes to avoid paying sales tax. </p>
		<p>By opening up the DukeCard system to all local merchants, Duke could avoid this appearance of impropriety, and Durham would receive the  sales tax revenue. Those hefty commissions and start-up fees would have to be  lowered too, which could really hurt DukeCard's profitability. Lucky for us, Duke is a non-profit organization, and doesn't care about  such things. </p>

		<p><strong>Letter: Much confusion over DukeCard taxation issue</strong> <br />
	    Herald-Sun, 2 January 2006 </p>
		<p>Michael   Palmer, a representative of Duke University,  was kind enough to reply to my letter in The Herald-Sun [Letters, Dec. 25, see  below]. He said that I was &quot;misinformed&quot; when I asserted that DukeCard  purchases were tax-exempt. OK. Let's check out my information. An article in  the Duke Chronicle of Oct. 28 reports that &quot;students can only pay for  purchases with points if they are delivered on campus.&quot; </p>
		<p>Then, the Chronicle actually gets a Duke official to provide  the reason: &quot;Director of Dining Services Jim Wulforst explained that meal  plan points are non-taxable and thus can only be used on campus. He added that Kemel Dawkins,  vice president for campus services, is currently in talks with lawyers about  the issue. Are these statements true or not? </p>
		<p>Whichever way you cut it, somebody at Duke  &quot;misinformed&quot; me. I'm not interested in affixing blame to either of  these individuals, but I think it demonstrates how frustrating it can be to  deal with Duke's administration. It's time for some straight answers. They have  heard our concerns, and told us that they'd get back to us with the details in  a month. It's now been well over two months. So, we're all waiting for a  comprehensive statement regarding the DukeCard and sales tax. Once that's  straightened out, we can move on to the next DukeCard question: Why is Duke skimming off 18 percent from each purchase, when other  universities are only charging 2-3 percent?</p>

		<p><strong>Letter: With its cards, Duke acts  like Donald Trump </strong><br />
	    Herald-Sun, 5 February 2006 </p>
		<p>So UNC, NC State and Elon University all have  reasonably-priced debit-card programs [Herald-Sun, Jan. 29] that provide  students with a wider range of choices, local merchants with more customers and  state governments with more tax revenues. </p>
		<p>Duke, which is considerably more well endowed than any of  those institutions, apparently gouges both their students and the local  merchants while accepting the two-fold subsidy we taxpayers give them as an  educational institution: Tax breaks for donors to the university and a pass on  the payment of property and sales taxes. </p>
		<p>Looks like they want it both ways: To be considered needy,  do-gooder education providers when it comes to claiming a public subsidy, while  playing aggressive, private sector-style entrepreneurs when it comes to  economic relations with the surrounding town. </p>
		<p>No one is suggesting that educational institutions shouldn't  get a tax break. But Duke should leave the Trump/Gates  tactics to the true private sector and be more generous with the fruits of the  community's investment. </p>

		<p><em>&quot;My assumption has been that it's a choice Duke has made to keep all its transactions on campus.&quot; <br />
	    -Tom   Campbell, Ninth Street merchant</em></p>
		<p><strong>'DukeCard' ruling on hold</strong><br />
	    Herald-Sun, 29 January 2006</p>
		<p>Duke still has made no decision  on a request last fall to allow students to use their university spending  accounts for purchases off campus. </p>
		<p>At other universities, however, the arrangement is common.  And it is much less costly than the 18 percent commission Duke charges in its  program that is now limited to restaurant deliveries to campus. </p>
		<p>Duke also charges the restaurants  about $1,200 in set-up fees. </p>
		<p>Elon University near Burlington,  on the other hand, has set-up charges and commissions less than one-third that  amount for 38 participating off-campus merchants. The businesses, moreover,  extend beyond food to include fitness gyms, auto-parts stores and an eye  center. </p>
		<p>Transactions on both Duke's DukeCard and the Phoenix Card  issued at Elon are administered by Blackboard, the education-support company  best known for its software with which teachers post course materials for their  students on computer systems. </p>
		<p>At both universities, as at most institutions, the cards  double as a student ID that is used for other campus purposes, such as building  access, cafeteria meal plans and as a library card. </p>
		<p>The Blackboard Transaction System software and equipment is  used by hundreds of colleges and universities, said a company spokeswoman, Melissa Chotiner.  Both Duke and Elon manage their off-campus transactions themselves, she said.  When Blackboard administers it, in an add-on service known as BBOne, fees are  &quot;less than a typical credit card,&quot; she said. </p>
		<p>Elon   University recently  lowered its off-campus costs for the Phoenix Card, and more merchants signed  on, said university spokesman David   Hibbard. </p>
		<p>&quot;We're not doing this to make money,&quot; Hibbard  said. &quot;We have a good relationship with merchants in the program.&quot; </p>
		<p>Two of the three Gold's Gym locations Matt Layman  operates in Burlington  began accepting the Phoenix Card two years ago. Earlier, he said, he was  skeptical about the 5 percent commission and $250 fee for each card reader  terminal. </p>
		<p>But after students repeatedly asked if he accepted the card,  he signed up. Only about 10 percent of his Elon student customers pay with it,  but that's still enough to make it worthwhile, he said. </p>
		<p>On Durham's  Ninth Street,  Tom Campbell, co-owner of The Regulator  Bookshop, said Elon's deal sounds good to him. </p>
		<p>&quot;I'd sign up for that in a flash,&quot; he said. </p>
		<p>As for Duke's higher charges -- prohibitively so for him, he  said -- &quot;My assumption has been that it's a choice Duke  has made to keep all its transactions on campus.&quot; </p>
		<p>At   UNC, students are issued a UNC  Card with an account for on-campus purchases. If they open a checking account  with Wachovia, they can have the bank's Visa Check card feature integrated into  the UNC Card, in a version called UNC Card Plus. </p>
		<p>The bank offers the option free to students. N.C. State   University has a similar  arrangement with Wachovia. </p>
		<p>Duke spokesman John Burness  said administrators aren't likely to change the Duke Card before the beginning  of a new academic year. He said he didn't know why Duke's fees are higher and  eligibility more restricted than Elon's. </p>
		<p>&quot;I think part of this has to do with the evolution of  this system, and that's why we're looking at it now,&quot; he said. </p>
		<p>In the fall, John   Schelp, president of the Old West  Durham Neighborhood Association near Duke's East Campus, asked Duke officials  to make the system, and its 11,000 cardholders, more merchant-friendly. He said  officials told him they would get back to him by November. </p>
		<p>Since then, in The Herald-Sun and in the Chronicle, Duke's  independent student newspaper, the issue has been raised periodically. </p>
		<p>On Tuesday, Schelp said he hopes administrators will  communicate their plans to interested parties outside the university  beforehand. </p>
		<p>&quot;We hope we would be able to see the rollout before  it's a done deal,&quot; he said. </p>
		<p>Burness said the university will advise merchants and students  once it reaches a decision. </p>

		<p><strong>Merchants seek DukeCard review</strong><br />
	    Duke Chronicle, 24 January 2006</p>
		<p>University officials are working on a plan to increase  DukeCard flexibility off campus, but the local group that requested the review  is upset with how long it is taking.</p>
		<p>Vice President for Campus Services Kemel Dawkins said he is  working with various administrators, including officials from Dining Services  and the DukeCard Office, to respond to complaints made in October about the  limitations of the DukeCard and the Merchants on Points program.</p>
		<p>Duke officials said they were working on remodeling the  DukeCard based on card programs at other schools, such as the University of North Carolina  at Chapel Hill.</p>
		<p>&quot;We are looking at options for providing additional  flexibility and additional opportunities for purchases on and off campus,&quot;  Dawkins said, noting that there was no specific date set for a new plan's  announcement or roll-out.</p>
		<p>&quot;We are looking at changes to the DukeCard as part of  that,&quot; he added.</p>
		<p>John Schelp,  president of the Old West Durham Neighborhood Association, claimed that the  University said it would respond to his group's complaints about the DukeCard  within one month from the time he spoke with Executive   Vice President Tallman Trask.  That conversation occurred Oct. 18, Schelp said.</p>
		<p>Initial complaints about the current DukeCard system  included students' inability to use food points or FLEX  money at off-campus vendors and the high startup costs and commission rates Duke charges vendors for the Merchants on Points program.</p>
		<p>Startup costs range from $1,500 to $3,500, and the  commission Duke takes for delivery purchases can be  up to 18 percent.</p>
		<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s disappointing because [Trask] said he would get  back to us but never did,&quot; Schelp said. &quot;It seems strange because the  initial response was encouraging. It's almost been an act of  disengagement.&quot;</p>
		<p>Dawkins said Trask, after acknowledging the complaints,  asked him to review the DukeCard and a possible expansion of its flexibility.</p>
		<p>Dawkins said he was never given a specific timetable for his  report and he has not been in contact with Schelp. </p>
		<p>Duke officials are looking at other campus systems &mdash;  including UNC &mdash; after which to model potential changes. The UNC OneCard allows  students to make purchases off campus by linking the card to a Wachovia  checking account.</p>
		<p>&quot;Other institutions use cards in a variety of  ways,&quot; Dawkins said. &quot;We need to decide which would work best at  Duke.&quot;</p>
		<p>Dawkins said he is looking at &quot;a variety of things in  relation to those issues&quot; of Merchants on Points and general card  flexibility, but he would not limit the scope of his review to just the  reduction of startup costs and fees.</p>
		<p>One reason administrators have cited in the past regarding  the difficulty in expanding the DukeCard program is the University's tax-exempt  status as a non-profit institution.</p>
		<p>When Duke students order food at Duke or through Merchants  on Points, they do not pay sales tax.</p>
		<p>&quot;If Duke is buying something  as an institution it's one thing, but individuals buying a pizza or something  is another,&quot; said Tom   Campbell, co-owner of The  Regulator Bookshop on Ninth Street.  &quot;It should be looked at in fairness to everyone else in this community  that pays sales tax.&quot;</p>
		<p>While Dawkins works on Duke's plan, Schelp and the community  will continue to wait.</p>
		<p>&quot;It's very clear that they know the ball is in their  court and we're waiting for an answer,&quot; Schelp said. &quot;You expect when  someone says they'll get back to you that they will.&quot;</p>
		<p>****</p>
		<p><strong>Duke Card blues: Merchants want rules eased for using  student card to buy off campus</strong><br />
	    Herald-Sun, 13 November 2005 </p>
		<p>The way John   Schelp sees it, Duke University  is an island of 11,000 credit-card holders who eat, drink and shop with  currency that most off-campus businesses can't accept. </p>
		<p>&quot;It's a captive audience you have on campus,&quot; he  said.</p>
		<p>That's why Schelp and some merchants are calling on the  university to make it easier for local businesses to accept Duke Cards, the  debit and meal card that's generally regarded as the standard currency on  Duke's campus. </p>
		<p>&quot;That's almost the only thing you take out of your  wallet all week,&quot; said Ian   Long, a sophomore English major  from California. </p>
		<p>But Duke requires off-campus  merchants to spend $1,200 in initial set-up costs and pay an 18 percent  commission to be able to accept the Duke Card. What's more, only restaurants can  participate and they have to deliver food to campus to take advantage of the  program. </p>
		<p>While 15 restaurants, 11 of them locally based, have signed  on to the plan since 1990, Schelp, president of the Old [West] Durham  Neighborhood Association, has heard others complain that the costs are  prohibitive. </p>
		<p>&quot;It's just too much,&quot; he said. </p>
		<p>He's pressing Duke President Richard  Brodhead and Executive   Vice President Tallman Trask  to make the system easier and cheaper. Trask agreed to review the program, and  Schelp expects to hear from him on Friday, a month from their last  conversation. </p>
		<p>But Schelp isn't just looking for financial concessions; he  also wants to see Duke allow all sorts of merchants to accept the Duke Card for  both on- and off-campus sales. </p>
		<p>&quot;This is good for Duke, it's good for town-gown  relations and it's good for students,&quot; he said. &quot;It's a  win-win-win.&quot; </p>
		<p>Duke is conducting a financial  and legal analysis of its existing program, spokesman John Burness  said. He wouldn't specify what aspects of the program might be tweaked. </p>
		<p>&quot;We have a variety of different options and no conclusions  yet,&quot; he said last week. &quot;Our goals in making whatever changes might  come about are to provide greater convenience to our students while helping to  encourage existing businesses closest to the campus to thrive.&quot; </p>
		<p>Students spend about $3 million a year on food purchases  from the 15 restaurants that deliver to campus as part of the Duke Card  program, Burness said.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&quot;The feedback  [from those businesses] is overwhelmingly positive,&quot; he said. Many vendors  have told Burness' colleagues that &quot;if they didn't have this relationship  with the Duke Card program, they wouldn't be in business,&quot; he said. </p>
		<p>Jimmy   John's Sandwich Shops, which just  started accepting the Duke Card and delivering to campus this year, is reaping  the benefits, said manager Tone Gould. Half of the Ninth Street restaurant's sales come from  Duke Card purchases, he said. </p>
		<p>Likewise, Pop's Trattoria has been accepting the Duke Card  since August. Even though the cost of the program is high, the extra business  is still a benefit, said Matthew Bason, who owns the Peabody Place restaurant with chefs Chris Stinnett and John Vandergrift. </p>
		<p>The order volume is currently low enough that it doesn't  require any extra staff, and students using the Duke Card aren't taking up  seats that would otherwise be occupied by diners paying all their money to  Pop's, he said. </p>
		<p>&quot;We're not losing business based on it, and the  business gained is business we didn't have before,&quot; Bason said. &quot;For  us, what the Duke Card offers is a little bit of an extra bonus to any night's  business.&quot;</p>
		<p>Pop's currently is filling four or five orders each night  through Gourmet Dining and Bakery, an Internet service developed by Duke  students that takes the orders and delivers the food to campus. Five of GDB's 11  participating restaurants accept the Duke Card; the others accept payment by  credit card only. </p>
		<p>Meanwhile, Blue Corn Caf&eacute; supports Duke, but its business is  strong enough that it doesn't need to accept the Duke Card and pay the  corresponding high commission, said owners Danielle  and Antonio Rios. The restaurant's margins are tight  enough without having to give a cut to the university, they said. </p>
		<p>The financial requirements aren't the only reason  restaurants don't participate. Fowler's Food and Wine co-owner William Simpson  would be happy to pay the commission if dealing with Duke weren't so difficult,  he said. </p>
		<p>&quot;We love Duke students and we'd love to be able to  offer the card,&quot; he said. &quot;But finding the right person who can make  the right decision -- we've run into logistical problems.&quot; </p>
		<p>The Regulator Book Shop also doesn't take Duke Cards, but  that doesn't stop students from trying to use them there, said co-owner John Valentine. </p>
		<p>&quot;Students always ask if we take Flex cards,&quot; he  said. &quot;They assume we do, but the tariff Duke  charges is too steep.&quot; </p>
		<p>The Regulator sells textbooks for 150 courses and also has a  good relationship with Duke's athletic department, Valentine  said. Still, he'd be happier if it were easier for students to spend money at  his store. </p>
		<p>&quot;With or without Duke, we will survive, but the more  Duke we can have, the better,&quot; he said. </p>
		<p>The perception has always been that the university  replicates the community's good ideas on campus so that students have no reason  to leave, Valentine said. But Ninth    Street also must make itself an attractive  alternative to Duke so students will venture out to nearby stores and  restaurants, he said. </p>
		<p>Long, who visits Ninth    Street about once a week to eat or shop at The  Regulator, said he leaves campus more often than many of his classmates. Local  businesses shouldn't have to accept the Duke Card to draw students to the  surrounding areas, he said, but he acknowledged it would be an effective  marketing strategy. </p>
		<p>&quot;People feel really comfortable in the Duke bubble and  aren't as willing to get off onto Ninth    Street as they should be,&quot; he said.</p>

		<p><strong>Local group pushes for Merchants on Points expansion</strong><br />
	    Duke Chronicle, 28 October 2005</p>
		<p>If the Old West Durham Neighborhood Association gets its  way, students may soon have more options for food on points and eventually be  able to use their DukeCards at local shops and restaurants.</p>
		<p>Two weeks ago the association sent a letter to President  Richard Brodhead with a request to lower the initial set-up and commission fees  for the Merchants on Points program in order to promote more small business  participation.</p>
		<p>The MOP system allows students to have food delivered from  restaurants in the local area using their meal plan food points.</p>
		<p>John   Schelp, president of the Old West  Durham Neighborhood Association, contended that the current program favors  larger businesses, such as chain restaurants that are better able to absorb the  costs of the program. He said that if Duke was  willing to lower the fees, more small local businesses would be able to  participate in the program.</p>
		<p>&quot;It would be great for students, and it would be great  for the community near campus,&quot; Schelp said.</p>
		<p>The Regulator Bookshop co-owner Tom Campbell  explained the difficulties the fees create.</p>
		<p>&quot;It's $3,000 to start and then there are commission  fees that can go up to 18 percent,&quot; Campbell said. &quot;We have to  offer a lot of discounts, so the fees would take half our profit.&quot;</p>
		<p>The Old West Durham Neighborhood Association also raised  concerns about the students' inability to use points off campus. In the MOP  system, students can only pay for purchases with points if they are delivered  on campus.</p>
		<p>&quot;We get asked fairly frequently if we take FLEX,&quot; Campbell said.</p>
		<p>Director of Dining Services Jim Wulforst explained that meal  plan points are non-taxable and thus can only be used on campus.</p>
		<p>He added that Kemel Dawkins,  vice president for campus services, is currently in talks with lawyers about  the issue.</p>
		<p>Some vendors already on the points system, however,  disagreed with the association's claims. Dan Mall,  Jimmy John's operating partner and area manager,  said the MOP fees actually make it harder for chain vendors to participate  because chain restaurants have franchise fees to pay as well. </p>
		<p>&quot;You can't just lower the fee and have everyone be  happy,&quot; Mall said.</p>
		<p>He added that the quality of service and ability to handle  customer volume must be taken into consideration.</p>
		<p>Wulforst agreed that quality is important in the success of  the system. &quot;If a vendor provides good food at a good price, they will get  the student business,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm all for an open market.&quot;</p>
		<p>There are currently more than 15 restaurants participating  in the MOP system. It has recently been expanded through Gourmet Dining and  Bakery, LLC&mdash;a student-founded delivery company that added Pop's Trattoria, The  Original Q-Shack, Dale's Indian Cuisine, Mad Hatters Caf&eacute; and Bake Shop and  Papa John's Pizza to the system.</p>
		<p>Overall, Schelp is optimistic about the constructive  response from Duke.</p>
		<p>&quot;The initial news from Duke is good,&quot; Schelp said.</p>
		<p>He spoke to Executive Vice   President Tallman Trask  about the issue and was told that the association would receive Duke's answer to  their concerns in a month.</p>
		<p>The interaction could represent a larger trend of  cooperation between the Duke and Durham  communities. &quot;I don't think this conversation would have happened two  years ago,&quot; Schelp said.</p>
		<p>He attributed the improvement to the influence of Brodhead  and Provost Peter Lange  and called Brodhead &quot;a breath of fresh air&quot; in his interactions with  the Duke administration.</p>

		<p><strong>Spreading the wealth</strong><br />
	    News &amp; Observer, 22 October 2005</p>
		<p>Old West Durham neighborhood activist John Schelp  reports some progress in his campaign to get Duke University  to cut its charges to merchants who accept DukeCards. According to Schelp,  university vice president Tallman   Trask has said Duke  &quot;is looking at ways&quot; to cut the startup cost and per-sale commissions  that discourage small businesses from accepting the card.</p>
		<p>Schelp said lower charges would benefit both merchants and  the students and Duke personnel who hold the cards by opening more off-campus  options for trade. Trask, he said, indicated &quot;they'll get back to me in a  month.&quot;</p>

		<p>&quot;...it is far worse to keep the surrounding business in  Durham at their  current disadvantage and to continue to deny them business from Duke  students.&quot;</p>
		<p><strong>Column: The dining bubble</strong><br />
		  by Elliott   Wolf, <br />
	    Duke Chronicle (17 January 2006)</p>
		<p>Self-described &ldquo;conservatives&rdquo; at Duke are fixated on the  notion that &ldquo;liberals&rdquo; are crowding out their ideas, as shown by the uproar  over &ldquo;academic freedom&rdquo; and Harry   Belafonte&rsquo;s Sunday appearance.  They might, however, want to look into something that costs each and every one  of us thousands of dollars every year and flies in the face of both common  sense and basic tenants of conservative philosophy:</p>
		<p>Duke Dining</p>
		<p>Although politicizing dining might seem an odd thing to do,  so many of the issues surrounding it boil down to basic questions of government  (institutional) intervention, economic freedom and government waste&mdash;things  which, once upon a time, Republicans actually took notice of. The only thing  that can save it: deregulation.</p>
		<p>As you all know, at the core of Duke Dining is the  requirement that all students purchase a meal plan. Freshmen are forced to eat  at the Marketplace, and all other undergraduates who live on campus are  required to purchase at least $1,420 in food points per semester that can only  be used to purchase food and only from specific vendors.</p>
		<p>Duke also, however, controls  merchants as well, arbitrarily assessing them a portion of their revenue (and  not just charging them rent and utilities) based on an owner&rsquo;s investment in  the eatery and a number of other factors, according to Jim Wulforst,  director of dining services. Vendors are rewarded by Duke Dining for spending  money on their establishments, leading to questionable improvements and a  disconnect between vendor profits and student business.</p>
		<p>Should students want to escape this system, we are heavily  taxed. Eighteen percent of our points spent at Durham businesses will be recycled back into  Duke (a total of $540,000 per year), according to Wulforst. This supposedly  makes up for the lost commissions from points going off campus. Considering  that a confidential Auxiliary Services budget presentation put all parking  ticket revenues at $600,000 in 2000, it&rsquo;s surprising that this tariff doesn&rsquo;t  earn more ire from the students.</p>
		<p>The results of this system are far reaching, and the main  losers are the students. Although Wulforst maintains that &ldquo;we pride ourselves  on being competitive,&rdquo; students still pay inflated prices and are severely  limited in our options. We cannot use the cards beyond the physical Duke  &ldquo;bubble,&rdquo; and when we purchase food for delivery from off campus, merchants  pass the commissions back to us. Although the money is used to improve eateries  each year, I don&rsquo;t think the freshmen now benefit from being told &ldquo;Happiness is  a perfume you cannot pour on others without getting a few drops on yourself,&rdquo;  by a plasma television in the Marketplace.</p>
		<p>Durham  merchants and community members are equally upset, as shown by recent coverage  in The Herald Sun. Restaurants in Durham,  unlike on-campus establishments, actually do have to face the cold reality of  paying rent, utilities and directly catering to customer demands. While it may  seem harsh to force on-campus establishments to do the same thing, it is far  worse to keep the surrounding business in Durham  at their current disadvantage and to continue to deny them business from Duke  students.</p>
		<p>Given all of this, why would Duke  so heavily regulate, subsidize and control everything? Duke  wants to promote on-campus dining establishments and ensure a variety of  options, a goal which is seemingly legitimate but could be served by less  intrusive means.</p>
		<p>The other goal is simply insulting. According to Wulforst, Duke wants to assure our parents that we actually eat, and  therefore must maintain the infrastructure that exits (&ldquo;bubble!&rdquo;). Surprisingly  enough, profit motive actually does not seem to be a significant influence.</p>
		<p>And ironically enough, the solution to all of this can be  found in our government-funded neighbor. UNC considers its students to be  qualified to decide when, where and how much to eat and does not require that  they purchase meal plans. Students who do choose to purchase a meal plan are subject  to many of the same restrictions as Duke students (including the 18 percent tax  on deliveries), but, according to Mike Freeman, director of auxiliary services  for UNC, &ldquo;our most expensive meal plan is $1,170 a semester.&rdquo; UNC students have  far more flexibility, spend much less on food and can support the surrounding  community at the same time. The market will provide.</p>
		<p>This seems to be something on which we as students should  all agree. I just find it bizarre that amid the &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; resurgence on  campus, it takes a registered Democrat to advocate free trade with the city of Durham and decry the  excesses of big &ldquo;government.&rdquo;</p>
