            DURHAM - Last month, neighborhood activist John Schelp fought off 
            the asphalt industry's effort to build more plants in Durham. 
            <p> Nearly 20 years ago, as a Peace Corps volunteer in the Congo, 
              he taught English, amid sick, starving children. 
            <p> Both times, he felt the same impulse. He wants to build the community 
              he lives in. 
            <p> "You see something that's wrong and you want to fix it," said 
              Schelp, sitting in his living room in Old West Durham, wearing an 
              African vest that matches the tapestries and masks on the wall. 
            <p> In a city bursting with jostling political interests, Schelp, 
              40, is emerging as one of its most effective activists. Since 1998, 
              he has taken his century-old neighborhood, an old mill village sliding 
              into decline, and given it a new name and a new identity. Last year, 
              he shaped a city law to limit where high-density apartments could 
              be built. He also helped get city and state historic markers celebrating 
              Durham's old blues musicians. 
            <p> Schelp, who projects both calm and high energy, has built relationships 
              with politicians, business leaders and other neighborhood groups. 
              He is president of the Old West Durham Neighborhood Association 
              and an executive committee member of the Durham NAACP. He is also 
              a member of the People's Alliance political group, where he was 
              vice president before being recruited to the National Association 
              for the Advancement of Colored People. 
            <p> People ask so often if he's going to run for office that he has 
              a stock response: Don't hold your breath. 
            <p> His motivation springs from his Peace Corps experience, Schelp 
              said. 
            <p> "When you see a child with a potbelly and a runny nose and flies 
              flying around his head, when you see that kind of abject poverty, 
              it changes you forever," he said. "You develop a purpose. You develop 
              a clearer sense of what's right and what's wrong in the world." 
            <p> For Schelp, a native of Washington, D.C., whose parents took him 
              traveling all over the world, the asphalt battle was his most visible 
              triumph yet. By accident, he came across a proposal by two companies 
              to change the city rules to open up 10 more sites for possible asphalt 
              plants. He discovered that all but one of the sites were in East 
              Durham, where poor blacks and Hispanics would bear the smell, noise 
              and possible health problems from the plants. 
            <p> He went into battle as chairman of the NAACP's community committee. 
              He rallied residents, students, and an army of data. The industry 
              backed down, withdrawing its proposal. The City Council will vote 
              on the proposal Monday, and Schelp expects it to be defeated, meaning 
              it could not be reintroduced for a year. 
            <p> People often ask what a white man is doing in the NAACP. Only 
              one other white person has sat on the executive committee in recent 
              years. 
            <p> Schelp chuckles. The NAACP was founded by both blacks and whites, 
              he said. The branch president, the Rev. Curtis Gatewood, calls Schelp 
              a star among the members. 
            <p> "It exemplifies the fact that black and white people can work 
              together and be effective together," Gatewood said. 
            <p> Before the asphalt battle, Schelp did most of his work as president 
              of the neighborhood association. Its members credit him for giving 
              Old West Durham its own identity, even its name. Before 1995, it 
              had neither. Real estate agents told their clients the area was 
              part of Watts Hillandale or the Ninth Street area. 
            <p> In the late 1980s, it had hit rock bottom, Schelp said, when Erwin 
              Cotton Mills closed and many residents lost their jobs. 
            <p> The neighborhood coalesced after an ugly incident in 1995. Three 
              men on Oakland Avenue started an intimidation campaign against their 
              neighbors, a white woman and a black woman who lived together. The 
              men used the N-word and shot off guns at night. One night, they 
              shouted vulgar, anti-black and anti-gay epithets through a bullhorn. 
            <p> Schelp wrote a letter to the editor denouncing their behavior. 
              Then, just as he and his wife were having their first baby, they 
              started getting hate calls and hang-ups. A red pickup truck cruised 
              past their house every day. 
            <p> The ringleader was indicted for a hate crime, in the first successful 
              indictment using the state's hate- crime statute. Another was evicted 
              from his house, and the third later died, Schelp said. 
            <p> In 1998, the neighbors elected Schelp president of the association. 
              He started small --with a sign. 
            <p> He wanted to put a sign announcing the neighborhood on Ninth Street, 
              its commercial heart, but city and state officials told him it would 
              be impossible. The city owned the land; the state owned the right-of-way; 
              there was too much red tape, they said. 
            <p> But Schelp persisted, and they got their sign. 
            <p> Today, the green and cream sign on Hillsborough Road reads, "Old 
              West Durham: Diversity, Harmony, Community." 
            <p> Schelp staged a ceremony. A City Council member came, a police 
              captain came. One merchant paid for the $600 sign; others donated 
              biscuits and flowers. The sun shone. Schelp was building a community. 
            <p> "That little sign ceremony pulled together the neighborhood," 
              Schelp said. "It was a huge shot in the arm. We had arrived." 
            <p> He and neighbor Pam Spaulding started an Old West Durham Web site: 
              <a href="index.html"  target="_new">http://www.owdna.org</a>. 
              There are oral histories. It tells the neighborhood's history, house 
              by house. The photo captions set down memories of places like the 
              house on Green Street that held people's stashes of white lightning 
              in floor-to-ceiling cabinets during Prohibition. It has dozens of 
              links, with newspaper articles and information about neighborhood 
              issues. 
            <p> Schelp started mailing the Web site's address to the City Council, 
              the Board of County Commissioners, all the political leaders, Spaulding 
              said. It won awards from local and state historic preservation societies. 
              The Library of Congress chose it as one of the state's 44 "local 
              legacies," along with the N. C. State Fair and the American Dance 
              Festival. 
            <p> "It was as if the neighborhood was almost discovered as a result 
              of his one-man campaign," said Spaulding, 38. 
            <p> Schelp arranged a neighborhood cleanup of a cemetery for workers 
              at the old Erwin Cotton Mills. Neighbors and mill workers' descendants 
              discovered the old graves and made it an annual event. Another piece 
              of the neighborhood had been resurrected, named, claimed. 
            <p> Then came bigger projects. When a mammoth apartment building was 
              planned near Erwin Square office tower, Schelp worked with the developers 
              to make the design reflect the nearby Erwin Mill building, with 
              a red-brick facade and tall windows. Construction on the 340-unit 
              complex is scheduled to start this summer. 
            <p> More important, he put the neighborhood's mark on the new law 
              that the city council had to pass to allow the new, high-density 
              complex. He shaped the law so that high-density complexes may only 
              be built near the stops planned for the future regional rail system. 
              Each project must also include open space. 
            <p> Then came Ninth Street North, a big commercial building cater-cornered 
              from Elmo's Diner on Ninth Street. Again, Schelp and the neighbors 
              worked with the developer to add red brick to the design, and set 
              the building close to the street like the older Ninth Street buildings. 
            <p> Only once, Schelp says, has the association had to battle with 
              a developer. That was Marvin Barnes, owner of M.M. Fowler oil company, 
              who owns, among other gas stations, the new Family Fare on Broad 
              Street at the corner of Markham Avenue. 
            <p> Barnes originally planned a big, flat "interstate-style" roof, 
              two rows of pumps and a conventional-looking convenience store. 
              Schelp and the residents wanted him to use a sloped roof, one row 
              of pumps, and the store's original design. They won. 
            <p> Schelp is a fighter, Barnes said. If he's against your project, 
              he'll find a way to stop it, or at least delay it. 
            <p> But in the case of the Family Fare, Barnes said, "What we ended 
              up doing is more attractive from a lot of people's perspective. 
              And because it's been well received, I would say he was right." 
            <p> One of Schelp's latest projects is to create a neighborhood gathering 
              space in a patch of creek and meadow across Green Street from E.K. 
              Powe Elementary School. The city has promised to pay for it, and 
              Schelp will have to negotiate with the owners of Erwin Square, whom 
              he expects will build near it. 
            <p> The neighborhood has no parks, he said. It needs a place to hold 
              its picnics and potlucks. 
            <p> "We need to create a heart of our community, and this would be 
              it," he said. <!--/STORY TEXT -->
