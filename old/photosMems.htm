		<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Text-Photos" -->The children of Old West Durham were just brought up differently than 
		    most children... our Moms and Dads were members of the greatest generation 
		    we all hear about, and working hard, whether it be our Dads and/or our 
		    Moms, was just the expected order of the day. Yet, they still had time 
		    for us children, and they were always nurturing and supportive. Grandparents 
		    were not the forgotten age they have become today... and in the grandest 
		    way, Grandparents were truly the steadfast cornerstones of the many 
		    people who lived in OWD. In the fondest sense... we grew up in the Mayberry 
		    tradition the entire World wishes they knew...

	      </font></p>
		  <p>My parents grew up in the Erwin Cotton Mill community of Old West Durham, 
		    nostalgically known as &quot;Monkey Bottom.&quot; Daddy used to tell 
		    me that when he was a boy, it was a wonderful, magical place in which 
		    to grow-up, and I can relate, because I too lived there. I've lived 
		    on Case Street, Page Street, Caswell Place, Anderson Street, and Erwin 
		    Road, and I played ball on the Erwin ball field. I attended Southside 
		    and E.K. Powe Elementary Schools, and if I close my eyes, I can vividly 
		    remember the smell of Jim Wagner's Grocery Store, and the taste of the 
		    wonderful cherry and vanilla cokes that were made behind the fountains 
		    at Brewer's and McDonald's Drug Stores on Ninth Street. </p>
		  <p>**</p>
		  <p>It was not unusual to receive a notice to move when you lived in one 
		    of Erwin Mill's houses on Mill Hill or in Monkey Bottom in West Durham, 
		    N.C... You have to remember... the houses were owned by the Mill, and 
		    you lived in the Mill's houses at the mercy of the Mill. </p>
		  <p>Often, when these houses would get into ill repair, they would move 
		    families to another Mill house, while they repaired the one that you 
		    and your family were in... Sometimes, the Mill would just tear down 
		    a house that had gone beyond repair. </p>
		  <p>One of my fondest memories, as a child, was when a house, scheduled 
		    for demolition, would become vacant. My brothers and I and the children 
		    in the neighborhood would play in the houses, and we had the best of 
		    times! We played Store, we played Army, or we pretended these treasures 
		    were Our Castles, and, literally, we just let our imaginations run wild. </p>
		  <p>Although we would be sad when the houses began to be demolished, this 
		    just sent a signal that a newer and greater adventure would soon occur. 
		    As the demolition teams began to tear down the houses, us children would 
		    scavenge the boards, and with our Daddy's old saw and hammer, we would 
		    use the boards to build a clubhouse or a fort of our own... No Girls 
		    Allowed! </p>
		  <p>All day long, we would work like ants moving the boards to my house, 
		    removing the old rusty nails, only to straighten them out again for 
		    re-use, and we would build our new Citadel... Gosh... what great times! </p>

	      </font></p>
		  <p>Halloween was a holiday where the children in West Durham all pretended 
		    to be something other than what we were: a Cowboy, an old man, a clown, 
		    etc. We actually pretended... something that today's children don't 
		    know how to do, and our parents accompanied us from house to house, 
		    as we carried either a large brown paper sack or a pillow case in which 
		    to receive candy (a seldom treat in those days) from our neighbors... 
		    And if we were really lucky, we would be invited into a neighbor's home 
		    for a cup of hot cider or cocoa...</p>
		  <p>**</p>
		  <p>It is leaf-raking time, and I remember as a child having to rake the 
		    leaves, and what fun it was to watch the green grass emerge again from 
		    beneath the various colors of the leaves... Then, we would all run and 
		    jump into the pile and start all over again... Sometimes, we would (my 
		    Daddy) burn the leaves, and I can still remember the aromas mixing with 
		    the smell of the home fires burning as the smoke from each chimney of 
		    the little houses on our neighborhood's streets rose and fell (mostly 
		    coal fires) to mingle with the smell of the burning leaves... I loved 
		    that smell, and I knew that the Holidays were not far away!</p>

		  <p>There is an old 1930's vintage, Silvertone banjo, and an old 1903 Thomas 
		    Edison Amberola that sits in the corner of my Study that belonged to 
		    my Grandfather and Grandmother, Julius Arthur and Martha Turner Carden. 
		    I also have an old trunk that belonged to my Grandparents, and I am 
		    told that when they got married, in 1910, everything they owned was 
		    in that trunk. My Grandmother Carden (herself a twin) bore 13 children, 
		    and of the 13 children, she bore two sets of twins... All of her children, 
		    but 4, did not survive. It was evident, by the stories that my Daddy 
		    told me, that their lives were filled with many hardships... Yet, through 
		    it all, I will always remember my Daddy's affinity for his childhood. 
		    When my Grandmother died in 1975, the banjo, the Blue Amberola, as it 
		    is known, and the trunk were given to me by my Daddy. I cherish these 
		    items, and they are a continuous reminder for the importance of my current 
		    family, and the connection I have with my family's era gone by. I remember, 
		    as a child, my Grandmother playing, what she called, the Edison, and 
		    I faintly remember my Grandfather playing the old banjo; he died in 
		    1957. The old phonograph played those old cylinder records, and to this 
		    day, both the Amberola and the Banjo play just fine... Each rings with 
		    an echo for yesterday's longing! I have several turn of the century 
		    records, including, &quot;Silent Night&quot; and &quot;Don't Let Your 
		    Deal Go Down.&quot; </p>
		  <p>**</p>
		  <p>When I was growing up, my Mama never cooked a turkey for Thanksgiving 
		    or Christmas; she and my Daddy said the meat was too dry. Instead, Mama 
		    would get Mr. Wagner, from Jim Wagner's store on Ninth Street, or Mr. 
		    Cottingham, from Cottingham's Grocery at the corner of Hillsboro Road 
		    and Lawndale Avenue (depended on where we lived), to order her a fresh 
		    hen and ham. </p>
		  <p align="center"><font color="#FF3300">.<img src="images/PhotosMems/frankloomfixer1953sm.jpg" alt="Uncle Frank the loom fixer" width="272" height="319" /></font></p>
		  <p align="center"><em><font color="Navy">Frank Marlow was a loom fixer 
		    at Erwin Mills. Ca. 1958</font></em></p>
		  <p> To accompany the hen and ham, Mama would cook a smorgasbord, which 
		    would have been envied by the local K&amp;W Restaurant... Mama's side 
		    dishes included creamed potatoes (potatoes boiled, creamed, hand-buttered, 
		    lightly salted, and hand mixed to a light, fluffy consistence); gravy 
		    (made in a pan, with sifted flour, salt and pepper, and the pan drippings 
		    from the hen); turnip greens or collards, and green beans (cooked in 
		    streaky-lean meat); candied yams, with plenty of cinnamon, brown sugar, 
		    and pecans; onion-saged dressing; potato salad; deviled eggs; corn; 
		    and homemade biscuits (kneaded, sifted flour, mixed with lard, buttermilk, 
		    and salt). For dessert, and always made from scratch, Mama would bake 
		    sweet potato pies; a fresh-grated, coconut cake (I remember breaking 
		    the husks with a hammer, and saving the coconut milk to ensure the cake 
		    would be moist... I remember grating the coconut and scraping my knuckles 
		    in the process); she would make a chocolate cake and a fresh pineapple 
		    cake, and there was always plenty of Mama's hot percolated coffee, from 
		    the stove, and sweet, sweet iced tea! Let me tell you... these were 
		    meals fit for a King! </p>
		  <p>Even at the normal meals, I can tell you this... the Carden family 
		    never went hungry, and although there were many meals when we did not 
		    have meat at the table; i.e., sometimes, we would just have vegetables, 
		    or we would have rice and stewed tomatoes for the main entree... we 
		    never had a meal without homemade biscuits or cornbread (flat-fried 
		    in the pan), and we always ate our meals together... each and every 
		    meal!!! These were wonderful times, even though, mealtimes would often 
		    turn into family discussion periods (sometimes not so pleasant, because 
		    we would talk about our school work, our grades, the things we should 
		    not have done that day...); but we did sit down together, and we worked 
		    out the Carden World's problems by the end of the meal... Most times, 
		    we would use these mealtimes to just &quot;catch up&quot; and enjoy 
		    one another's company...</p>

		  <p>Many of you who also lived in this Old West Durham neighborhood, and 
		    even though our community may have been viewed as a community with little 
		    societal means, being underprivileged in a monetary sense did not mean 
		    that we were not wealthy in the important things of life. Actually, 
		    in the spirit of love, honor, and respect for one another, we were truly 
		    the richest people in the world! For we had a real sense of community.a 
		    common thread of commitment to one another, we were the epitome of a 
		    proud people.<font color="#FF3300"><br />
