        <p><b><font color="Navy">Letter to Durham DOT:</font></b></p>
        <p>Neighbors have observed some unsafe areas for young<br>
          pedestrians next to EK Powe and approached the school<br>
          about creating a safer environment for our students.</p>
        <p>In talking with the school principal, PTA, site-based<br>
          decision committee and others, we learned that a short<br>
          list of safety improvements had already been submitted<br>
          to the City last year.</p>
        <p>Apparently, Durham had received a DOT grant for a Walk<br>
          to School program. EK Powe was the only school that<br>
          expressed an interest.</p>
        <p>After meeting with the principal and parents about<br>
          improvements that would make walking safer for<br>
          students, the group agreed on a fairly inexpensive<br>
          list (see below).</p>
        <p>We understand this request was passed on to Public<br>
          Works, who agreed it was do-able.</p>
        <p>Folks assumed at the time that these elements would be<br>
          handled in Engineering's rotation of construction<br>
          projects. Sadly, we understand the DOT grant money has<br>
          now expired.</p>
        <p>The safety improvements are not costly:</p>
        <p>* re-striping of existing Ninth Street crossing in<br>
          front of school,</p>
        <p>* signs saying &quot;Watch for Pedestrians,&quot;</p>
        <p>* striped crosswalk and curb cuts at the two ends of<br>
          the curved sidewalk on Edith St (back of school),</p>
        <p>* updating the &quot;No Parking&quot; signs at the crosswalk<br>
          on Ninth Street (to match the correct time school now<br>
          opens and closes),</p>
        <p>From our discussions this summer, we have one more,<br>
          low-cost improvement that would provide a safer<br>
          environment for families...</p>
        <p>* establish two or three 20-minute parking spaces on<br>
          the west side of Ninth Street (in front of the lower<br>
          doors by the school admin offices).</p>
        <p>These new parking spaces would allow late-arriving<br>
          parents to pull out of traffic before dropping off<br>
          their kids (right now, parents are forced to stop in<br>
          traffic and let their children out). The parking<br>
          spaces would also allow parents and visitors to<br>
          quickly come and go during the day, in a safer manner.</p>
        <p>The Old West Durham Neighborhood Association is<br>
          willing to work with you to help secure these<br>
          improvements to help create a safer environment for<br>
          our children.</p>
        <p>Would you please email me a time-frame for these<br>
          projects in the pipeline? Thank you so much.</p>

        <p><b><font color="Navy">Protecting retail districts near Duke</font></b></p>
        <p>The twelve Duke-Durham partnership neighborhoods recently held a series 
          of meetings with Duke officials to discuss a proposed University-College 
          (UC) zoning district. During these meetings, a number of changes were 
          made to the UC district with the general agreement of all those in attendance. 
          We then learned that Duke officials were quietly working behind the 
          scenes lobbying the City for a significant change in the ordinance to 
          allow large on-campus retail centers (something we clearly opposed). 
        </p>
        <p>This lobbying was done without first informing the other stakeholders 
          and prompted dozens of emails to Dr. Nan Keohane and City Council. Community 
          members asked that the ordinance retain the 'limited retail' language 
          arrived at during the neighborhood meetings. Many felt that creating 
          a commercial center on campus would hurt retail shops at Brightleaf, 
          Ninth Street, West Chapel Hill Street, downtown, and locally-owned Northgate. 
          Vacant storefronts would have a negative ripple effect in the same partnership 
          neighborhoods Duke is trying to help.</p>
        <p>On April 7, Duke informed the neighborhoods that it supported the UC 
          ordinance 'as is' (ie. as drafted at the stakeholders meetings). That 
          night, the Durham City Council unanimously approved the new UC zoning 
          district -- with the 'limited retail' language intact. The coalition 
          of partnership neighborhoods will keep a careful eye on retail plans 
          for Duke's Central Campus.</p>
        <p><b><font color="Navy">Final Word: A way that works</font></b> (N&amp;O, 
          January 5, 2003)</p>
        <p>Our neighborhood association recently asked the Durham planning director 
          to accelerate approval of high-density apartments in our community.</p>
        <p>Not all neighborhood-developer relationships have to be as contentious 
          as the Coker Tower saga. Old West Durham is not your father's neighborhood 
          association. We're pretty reasonable when it comes to new development 
          and, after meeting early with developers, don't often oppose projects.</p>
        <p>We knew that Durham's proposed high-density ordinance, Ninth Street 
          North, the Ninth Street regional rail station, Ninth Street Commons 
          and the Erwin Square apartments would bring more traffic and other changes. 
          But we also understand that we live in an urban setting and supported 
          these in-fill projects.</p>
        <p>Erwin Square is a good example. In the 1980s (before our group existed), 
          a vicious battle ensued over plans to build the Erwin Square tower. 
          This past year, when Erwin Square proposed a 340-unit apartment complex, 
          the headlines spoke of cooperation between the community and developers.</p>
        <p>What changed? The neighborhood had become more empowered. Developers 
          (and their attorneys) know this and understand the need to contact us 
          early in the process. They also know they can't sneak something past 
          us. We respect them, and they respect us. So we work together and both 
          sides benefit.</p>
        <p>Confrontational headlines over Erwin Square never materialized, and 
          the project was approved.</p>
        <p>At the same time, many developers need to be reminded that they are 
          not entitled to re-zonings. Folks also need to know that for every tax 
          dollar generated by new residential development, taxpayers spend $1.50 
          in more schools, new parks, street improvements, additional police protection, 
          etc (Wake County budget office, 1999).</p>
        <p>Triangle towns could learn from each other. Durham should follow Raleigh's 
          lead setting a six-week waiting period between notification and a hearing. 
          Bull City neighborhoods receive written notifications of projects as 
          late as ten days before a hearing (we recently learned of a project 
          three working days before comments were due). </p>
        <p>Frustrations mount when the community has to scramble to understand 
          what's being proposed, discuss with neighbors and the board, reach a 
          decision and play phone tag with the applicant. Durham's system of late 
          notifications also frustrates developers who are contacted on the eve 
          of a hearing -- creating unnecessary problems. </p>
        <p>This year's successful NAACP-led fight against more asphalt plants 
          in East Durham (where our Planning Department had begun handling the 
          asphalt industry's measure at least six months before residents knew 
          of the proposal) resulted in two improvements: 1) neighborhoods are 
          now notified of any proposals to change the county-wide ordinance and 
          2) County Commissioner chair Ellen Reckhow asked the manager to set 
          up a "Durham Neighborhood Planning Institute" (where residents can take 
          free Saturday classes to learn more about the planning process). After 
          all, who would want to keep neighborhoods in the dark?</p>
        <p>The development industry could learn a thing or two from this emerging, 
          smarter school of developers in Durham. More old-guard developers may 
          eventually realize that they'd benefit more if they'd truly partner 
          with the community.</p>

        <p><font size="3">Dear County Commissioners,</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">As you know, the Historic Preservation Society of Durham 
          and the Old West Durham Neighborhood Association asked the County to

        <p><font size="3">We ask for your support at Monday's meeting. Without 
          spending a dime, the County will help play a major role in revitalizing 
          the western side of one of Durham's oldest neighborhoods. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">The historic homes would become a focal point at the 
          western gateway to Old West Durham and stop commercial creep from coming 
          into the residential area. Residences also would produce less traffic 
          than a commercial use at a dangerous intersection that has a significant 
          blind spot.</font></p>

          <u>East End Connector</u>: Letter to the Editor</font></b></font></p>
        <p>Dear Council and Commissioners,</p>
        <p>The board of the Old West Durham Neighborhood Association joins a rising 
          chorus of neighborhood voices in support of a less-expensive alternative 
          to Eno Drive. The East End Connector would provide a rapid connection 
          for folks who live north and east of Durham and work in RTP. </p>
        <p>Much of the traffic traveling from I-85 to the Durham Freeway wouldn't 
          have to clog neighborhood streets. Alston Ave gets backed up every day. 
          To avoid the back-ups, cars and trucks are cutting through neighborhoods 
          around Alston, Holloway, Geer and Angier. </p>
        <p>We've talked with folks in East Durham who said fair compensation is 
          due to the homeowners to be displaced. But that traffic is terrible 
          in the Alston/Avondale corridor and would support anything to help get 
          cut-through traffic off the streets. (While more than 100 houses would 
          be demolished for Eno Drive, the connector would affect six houses.)</p>
        <p>The back-ups on Alston and the long route through downtown up Roxboro 
          Road, result in many drivers taking exits farther west on Rt. 147 (through 
          Trinity Park, Walltown, Old North Durham and Duke Park). </p>
        <p>This one-mile connector could help improve traffic congestion on several 
          Durham streets (thereby improving the safety of our pedestrians). We 
          join others in the community in asking you to carefully consider the 
          <a href="http://www.durhamloop.org">East End Connector</a>. </p>

                amendment that would reduce buffers between asphalt plants and 
                nearby houses. Asphalt fumes contain at least six known carcinogens. 
                Asphalt plants have no business going near houses anywhere in 
                Durham. </p>
              <p>We are concerned that while planning officials have stated they 
                don't understand the public health and environmental justice implications 
                of asphalt plants, the early information they have about the public 
                health implications seems to have been provided to them primarily

        <p>If this proposed amendment were to pass, one of the 10 potential asphalt 
          plant sites would run west behind the Hillsborough Road Visart Video 
          store to the area around Cole Mill Road and Interstate 85. Why would 
          planning staff and elected officials allow construction of an asphalt 
          plant upwind from the Crest Street, Old West Durham, Walltown, Duke 
          Manor and Watts Hospital-Hillandale neighborhoods? </p>
        <p>The &#147;compromise&#148; reported in the Feb. 7 Herald-Sun (&#147;Asphalt 
          company backs off on buffer&#148;) that would reduce the 1,500-foot 
          buffer the zoning ordinance currently requires around asphalt plants 
          to 750 feet is hardly a compromise. </p>
        <p>Asphalt plants could still be built at all 10 proposed sites with a 
          750-foot buffer. We urge all concerned citizens to contact the City 
          Council and planning officials and ask them to oppose the proposed zoning 
          ordinance amendment. </p>

        <p>January 5, 2000 </p>
        </font> 
        <p> <font size="2">Dear members of the Durham City Council, </font> 
        <p> 
        <p><font size="2"> The Old West Durham Neighborhood Association would 
          like to make you aware of the need for a community park across from 
          E.K. Powe Elementary School. The purpose of this letter is to update 
          the multi-term City Council members of our activities and to let the 
          new members know of our ongoing efforts to create a park near Ninth 
          and Green Streets. </font> 
        <p> 
        <p><font size="2"> Old West Durham is a neighborhood in transition. We 
          are densely developed and there is little open space available for a 
          community greenspace. Home to some 800 households and the Ninth Street 
          Shopping District, our neighborhood stretches from East Campus to Hillandale 
          Road and from Englewood Avenue south to the railroad tracks. Having 
          already lost two parks to road construction, our neighborhood remains 
          without a park. </font> 
        <p> 
        <p><font size="2"> The support we have received so far from the City has 
          been outstanding. We are delighted that we were able to show the site 
          of our proposed green spaceto Nick and Howard. Everyone we have encountered 
          in City Hall has been positive and supportive. In fact, you should soon 
          be receiving the CIP which will include an item for green spaceacross 
          from E.K. Powe. </font> 
        <p> 
        <p><font size="2"> There are a number of reasons why the proposed Green 
          Street site would make an ideal location for green space. </font> 
        <p> 
        <p><font size="2"> With the expanded development of Erwin Square on the 
          horizon, establishing a green space now is a proactive opportunity to 
          provide a wide buffer along South Ellerbe Creek for the neighborhood 
          and the elementary school (before new development plans are submitted). 
          A community green space would also help attract visitors and customers 
          to Ninth Street and allow ensuing generations of E.K. Powe students 
          to continue their outdoor biology and ecology lessons. </font> 
        <p> 
        <p><font size="2"> Our community has a long history of having and losing 
          neighborhood parks to development. According to "The Durham Architectural 
          and Historic Inventory," the West Durham community had a park before 
          Durham had any City parks. This first park was built more than one hundred 
          years ago (in 1895) in the large grove across the railroad tracks opposite 
          the Erwin Textile mills. The park was equipped with swings and benches 
          and "almost instantly became the social and recreation center of the 
          community's life." In 1922, Erwin Auditorium was built in the park. 
          </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> But, West Durham lost this park when the Durham Freeway 
          was pushed through. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> Later the West Durham got another park when the West 
          Durham Community Center and park was built at Hillsborough Road and 
          Hillandale. But, we lost that park when Hillandale Road was widened 
          and extended to Duke Medical Center. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> After we lost the West Durham Community Center, our 
          good friends in Watts Hospital- Hillandale were able to add yet another 
          park to their neighborhood. They now have four City parks while we remain 
          with none. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> All we're asking for is our park back. We are asking 
          for your help in seeing that the promise that our neighborhood would 
          get a green space to replace the last park we lost is fulfilled. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> According to the Planning Department, the Erwin Square 
          project did not have to have a development plan when it was initially 
          proposed, since the project did not require a rezoning. So the site 
          plan was approved based on the zoning ordinances in effect at the time. 
          An approved site plan is good for two years -- anything on the approved 
          plan not built within two years of approval is no longer valid. If the 
          developers want to come in with a new site plan for an unbuilt section 
          of the Erwin Square project, it will be subject to the existing ordinances, 
          including the Resource Protection Ordinances (RPO). </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> Our friends in the Planning Department have indicated 
          that Durham's RPO offers buffer protections along South Ellerbe Creek 
          (which runs through the middle of the green space site). Since the creek 
          is clearly designated on the official US Department of Agriculture map 
          and since it has a drainage basin that is greater than 25 acres, the 
          RPO calls for a significant buffer on either side of South Ellerbe Creek. 
          </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> Old West Durham is a historically significant neighborhood 
          and is listed as a National Historic District. The archaeological significance 
          of the area closest to the mill site is specifically mentioned in the 
          National Park Service documentation granting West Durham National Registry 
          Historic District status. West Durham's earliest worker homes were built 
          next to the mills. Thus the 1986 National Park Service report states 
          that there are significant historic and archaeological reasons why this 
          site should remain undeveloped. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> Creating a green space on Green Street would help us 
          build community and improve the quality of life that we all desire. 
          Watts-Hillandale, E.K. Powe, the Friends of South Ellerbe Creek and 
          a number of other community groups will be sending you letters in support 
          of the proposed green space. </font>

        </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Late last night 
          [8/14/01], the Zoning Committee voted 7-0 to incorporate the Old West 
          Durham Neighborhood Association's recommendations into Durham's newly 
          proposed high-density zoning category (see letter below). </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Zoning Committee 
          requested staff to: 1) explicitly link the high-density category to 
          regional rail station sites approved by the TTA Board of Trustees (to 
          prevent high-density development from cropping up all over Durham), 
          2) create a new 60 unit/acre category (mid-range zoning category that 
          falls between 40 units/acre and 80 units/acre) and 3) require "Urban 
          Design Plans" for areas like Erwin Square (so elements like open space 
          are not left out).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We are encouraged 
          our recommendations were unanimously endorsed by the Zoning Committee. 
          It is our hope City Council will also support this reasonable language 
          in Durham's proposed high-density zoning categories.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Dear Zoning Committee

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Old West Durham 
          Neighborhood Association enthusiastically supports TTA&acute;s Regional 
          Rail Project - Phase One. We also believe that it is appropriate to 
          develop lively, intense, mixed-use areas around the stations. Thus, 
          OWDNA supports the creation of new zoning categories that would allow 
          for the development of such vibrant areas. However, we have a number 
          of recommendations which we feel would improve the categories under 
          consideration. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Requiring prior 
          completion of Urban Design Plans in target station areas </b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">As a neighborhood, 
          accepting high-intensity projects without without the context of an 
          overall plan for the station area is disconcerting. As existing residents 
          and business owners, we should be able to participate in planning for 
          the area as a whole. In this way, we can work with the city and landowners 
          to create a vision for all the types of buildings, activities and infrastructure 
          that will be needed. Then, all parties could decide whether a specific 
          project proposal fits into that vision. The urban design plan would 
          need to include plans for new streets, sidewalks, bike lanes, bus service 
          amenities, parking, parks, plazas, and major systems like stormwater 
          control and transportation capacity. Designing these elements in advance 
          will result in a better functioning place than if each issue is raised 
          on a piecemeal basis, property by property. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Particularly because 
          the new zoning categories exempt any requirements for open space, it 
          is important to plan early for any parks, plazas, or other public spaces 
          that would be desirable to make these station areas vibrant, welcoming 
          places. Without prior design for these places, very intense development 
          could occur on the parcels within the station area, without any accommodation 
          for these important public spaces. For these reasons, we believe that 
          requiring an urban design plan for the station areas prior to granting 
          rezonings for high-density residential uses is essential. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Requiring prior

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;Since these 
          new zoning categories are intended to support increased activity around 
          Regional Rail Stations, rezoning to a high density residential category 
          should be predicated on the approval of the station site by TTA&acute;s 
          Board of Trustees. </font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We believe that 
          a fourth category should be considered which would allow up to 60 units 
          per acre. We believe that this category is more appropriate for a neighborhood 
          like Old West Durham, than an 80 unit per acre category. We believe 
          that the 80 unit per acre category is appropriate for Downtown Durham 
          and RTP. </font></p>

          business owners in Old West Durham, we are concerned above the long-term 
          health of our neighborhood. We want new buildings to have a productive 
          life well beyond the typical 20-year mortgage life of apartment developments. 
          By requiring apartment units to be &#147;condo-ready,&#148; this improves 
          the chances that the apartments can be converted to owner-occupied condominium 
          units if the local housing market should change. </font></p>

          to those stated above for condominium conversion, ensuring that units

          and pedestrian-oriented. It is important that projects within walking 
          distance of a rail station have complete sidewalk and bicycle access. 
          Buildings should be brought up to the back of sidewalk and parking should 
          be accommodated in the rear or in decks. Street level floors should 
          be required to have windows, forbidding a &#147;blank face&#148; to 
          the street. </font></p>

        <P> <FONT SIZE=2> The neighborhood of Old West Durham stretches across 
        the northern boundary of Duke University (from East Campus to the doors 
        of the Medical Center) and is part of the Duke-Durham Neighborhood Partnership 
        Initiative. 
        <P> 
        <P> Listed on the National Registry of Historic Districts, our community 
          was first settled along the railroad tracks before the arrival of Trinity 
          College, before the arrival of Erwin Cotton Mills, and before Dr. Bartlett 
          Durham donated land to create Durham Station. 
        <P> 
        <P> Today, the board of the Old West Durham Neighborhood Association is 
          disappointed at Duke University's public comments regarding the long-planned 
          regional rail stop at Duke's medical center. We urge Duke to be more 
          flexible in its approach to this important regional effort. We have 
          a number of concerns: 
        <P> 
        <P> 1. Several neighbors living close to Duke are frustrated at the university's 
          two-sided policies. On the one hand, Duke says it is important to reach 
          out to the community while, on the other hand, it is turning its back 
          on an important regional effort that will help neighborhoods across 
          Durham and across the Triangle by helping to alleviate our congested 
          roads and improve air quality. 
        <P> 
        <P> 2. As Durham's largest employer, Duke's opposition to the medical 
          center station will result in lower ridership and could irreparably 
          harm the system as a whole.

        <P> 3. For Duke University to claim that regional rail would create a 
          "wall" is unfortunate. Many in the Bull City already see many walls 
          at Duke (both literally and figuratively). And for Duke to express concerns 
          about noise is perplexing considering that the state's largest heliport 
          is located at the medical center (leaving nearby neighbors living under 
          the copter-jet flight paths to deal with the resulting noise pollution). 
        <P> 
        <P> 4. Opposing the medical center regional rail station is short-sighted. 
          In the 1970s, Georgetown (an elite neighborhood in Washington, DC) opposed 
          the building of a metro station in its "back yard." Today, Georgetown 
          is a sea of clogged traffic and impossible-to-find parking. Merchants 
          and neighbors suffer from customers and visitors complaining that they 
          no longer go there due to the twin crises of parking and traffic. 
        <P> 
        <P> 5. Duke is closing the door on the thousands of employees who could 
          take advantage of transit options (for economic reasons or simply to 
          get to work faster and more efficiently than fighting increasing traffic 
          on Triangle roads). Not everyone who works at Duke, or who needs medical 
          attention there, can afford a private car. 
        <P> 
        <P> 6. Parking is a big, expensive problem at Duke. Regional rail would 
          help alleviate the university's parking crunch. 
        <P> 
        <P> 7. Efforts to build a regional rail system will ease smog problems 
          by providing an attractive alternative for commuters who now drive cars 
          to work. 
        <P> 
        <P> 8. According to the AAA Life Insurance Company, every 13 minutes one 
          American is killed in an auto accident. Regional rail would offer a 
          safer alternative. 
        <P> 
        <P> 9. Why wait until late in the game for the announcement opposing the 
          medical center site? The planned route, with a stop at the medical center, 
          has been public knowledge for a considerable amount of time. And, the 
          last-minute alternative site proposed by Duke (trying to squeeze a station 
          on a steep incline next to the Durham Freeway) would also have harmed 
          ridership because commuters would be more reluctant to take regional 
          rail if they had to transfer to buses to get to work. The site was hastily 
          chosen -- Duke didn't even have the time to check with the NC Department 
          of Transportation for their input before announcing its alternative 
          site (DOT quickly rejected the location). Much effort went into the 
          planning for regional rail -- efforts and resources that would be wasted 
          if Duke is not more flexible in its approach. 
        <P> 
        <p> The Old West Durham Neighborhood Association is troubled by Duke's 
          intransigence on regional rail. We feel strongly that supporting viable 
          regional rail is important. Regional rail is good for Durham, and Duke 
          should be at the forefront of encouraging its swift development. Regional 
          rail will bring visitors from other Triangle communities to the Bull 
          City; increase commercial opportunities for downtown, Brightleaf and 
          Ninth Street businesses; and spur the development of revitalized housing, 
          additional shopping and new employment opportunities for Durham residents 
          living and working near the rail corridor. Regional rail would benefit 
          everyone -- including Duke University. </p>

        <P> <FONT SIZE=2>With our neighborhood in the bull's eye between the growing 
          number of residential developments to our north and west and with the 
          growth of employment centers to our south and east, the Old West Durham 
          Neighborhood Association is concerned about traffic speeding through 
          our neighborhood. <BR>
          <BR>
          In an attempt to slow down traffic in our community, the OWDNA has been 
          working with the City to develop a neighborhood traffic calming plan. 
          <BR>
          <BR>
          While we have discussed various traffic calming measures in recent newsletters, 
          below is an update from the plan that we developed with the City of 
          Durham (following a traffic analysis by the Durham Department of Transportation). 
          <BR>
          <BR>
          OWDNA has historically opposed shifting traffic or blocking off streets. 
          We feel strongly that when you start to block off streets, you shift 
          the traffic burden to the folks living on nearby streets (and you fall 
          into the trap of having to block off even more streets). While we will 
          not try to unblock any streets (especially with the development of Erwin 
          Square in our future), we have not and will not take any action to block 
          any neighborhood streets. <BR>
          <BR>
          For these reasons, we are advocating the use of traffic circles and, 
          if neighbors agree, the possibility of one speed hump on Green and one 
          on Iredell. Traffic circles are working well in Trinity Park (where 
          you can see them on Englewood and on Knox). Small circles in the intersection 
          do not touch the existing curbs. A landscaped traffic circle would encourage 
          a motorist speeding through Old West Durham to slow down and realize 
          that he/she is in a neighborhood with homes, kids and pets. <BR>
          <BR>
          Traffic measures like traffic circles and speed humps would require 
          the signature of 75% of the property owners within a one-block area 
          of the site. <BR>
          <BR>
          If you live near Hale and Green or on Iredell (south of Knox), you may 
          be visited by someone from OWDNA asking you to sign the petition. (The 
          City requires property owners to sign valid petitions). <BR>
          <BR>
          Our traffic calming plan is the result of resident feedback, work by 
          the OWDNA board and input from the City of Durham. <BR>
          <BR>
          Please call 541-5723 (day) if you have any questions. <BR>

              <b>Oakland Avenue (at West Knox) </b><br>
              Traffic Circle (as the only straight shot through the heart of OWD 
              between Club and Hillsborough, this intersection was our initial 
              priority). <br>

              <b>Lawndale Avenue (at Hillsborough Rd) </b><br>
              Small Channelization Island (the problem is that eastbound vehicles

              Avenue). <br>
              <br>
              <b>Green Street (at Oakland)</b> <br>
              Curb revision (make intersection more like an "X" shape). The objective 
              is to reduce confusion and the speed of traffic turning from northbound 
              Oakland Avenue onto eastbound Green Street. <br>
              <br>
              <b>Green Street (at Hale Street)</b> <br>

              hump between Knox & Green <br>
              <br>
              According to the City, the low volume of traffic on streets like 
              Virgie, Carolina, and Edith would not qualify those roads for traffic 
              calming measures. Our focus here is on the major roads cutting across 
              the neighborhood. <br>
              <br>
              Since this is a neighborhood approach to traffic calming, the City 
              supports establishing a 25 mph speed limit on those streets within 
              the study area which are not already 25 mph: Golf Street, Lawndale 
              Avenue, Knox Street, Virgie Street and Edith Street. </font></td>

        <p>Fourteen OWD neighbors spruced up the greenspace on Green Street (near 
          Ninth St) in March, 1999. Neighbors and friends came and filled four 
          pickup trucks worth of debris. The refuse was hauled away by the city's 
          Impact Team, which also provided the pickers, bags and yard tools to 
          help with the clean up. When you push through the brush, the rolling, 
          gentle hills and winding paths around the clearing hint at the possibilities 
          for a wonderful urban space for Old West Durham. </p>
        <p>However, there are questions about a large "dye pond" surrounded by 
          a screened fence near the creek. The dye pond is left over from the 
          Erwin textile mill -- when run-off from the mill operations used to 
          flow away from the mill (apparently, in the past, the neighborhood often 
          smelled like a big laundry mat from the warm water that flowed out of 
          the mills). </p>
        <p>We don't know if the dye pond is something to worry about but, are 
          checking with local and state contacts. Its placement next to an elementary 
          school and near many homes should be a concern. Potential risks associated 
          with the dye pond include possible residues in the water or leaching 
          into the surrounding soil and creek bed. If nothing else, it is a huge 
          breeding place for mosquitoes. </p>
