<p>The  4-mile hike took walkers by West Ellerbee Creek, to the N.C. School of Science  and Math (formerly Watts Hospital), through Walltown, Trinity Heights  and East Campus. The group also hiked down Watts Street past Trinity Park,  by E.K. Powe Elementary and through an old mill  village. </p>

<p>Even  though some of the hikers have spent their whole lives in Durham, many said they have still not gotten  to learn about all of the area's history... &quot;I learned more today than I  have in the last sixty-four years,&quot; said Freddie Cable,  who grew up in West Durham and currently lives  in the city. </p>

<p>Cam  McDonald can recall the good old days when drugstores were the focal point of a  town -- a doctor's office, restaurant and gossip post in one...

<p><strong>Durham</strong><strong> residents  hold optimistic views on new campus</strong> <br />
  (Duke Chronicle, 1 February 2007)</p>
<p>After  dozens of meetings within the community and behind closed doors in the Allen  Building, administrators and neighborhood representatives settled on a 12-point  binding agreement in January that, among other things, includes a 50,000-sq.  ft. cap on retail space for the new Central, said John Schelp, president of the  Old West Durham Neighborhood Association and a leader of the stakeholders  group, which is involved in negotiations with University officials.</p>
<p>With  the agreement, John   Valentine, Trinity '71 and owner  of the Regulator Bookshop, said the University will be expected to follow  &quot;good faith&quot; policies in making decisions for the new Central and  avoid infringing on local businesses' bread and butter with its &quot;no  tax-paying behemoth lead foot.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Erwin Road is going  to become the most public face of Duke,&quot; Schelp said, adding that the  location of the road will make retail space there very accessible to the  public. &quot;We were trying to limit the amount of shopping Duke could cram  into that space. Duke's mission is academics not shopping.&quot;</p>
<p>City  Council member Mike   Woodard said the University's  willingness to work alongside the neighborhood associations was a &quot;tipping  point&quot; in the Council's vote, but added that the community supported the  Central plans from the onset.</p>

<p><strong>Editorial: A welcome  compromise</strong> <br />

<p>Congratulations  to Duke University officials and members of a  community &quot;stakeholders&quot; group who worked long and hard to hammer out  agreement on 12 conditions to clear the way for the university to move forward  with plans to develop its massive 128-acre Central Campus project... Thhe  community struggled long and hard with this one. In the long run, we think such  thorough and thoughtful discussions about major projects such as Central Campus  are healthy for the community.</p>
<p><strong>Editorial: Elbow room for  Duke</strong> <br />
  (News &amp; Observer, 28 January 2007)</p>
<p>It  took months for the Durham City Council finally to approve development of Duke University's  massive Central Campus project, but that's good. The assemblage of new student  housing, classrooms, arts and office buildings, student eateries and other  shops between the current East and West campuses was opposed by residents in  surrounding neighborhoods and&nbsp;by merchants who worried, understandably,  about competition... In short, the entire Durham  community has a stake in a project that will allow the university to grow and  flourish.</p>
<p><strong>Pilot bus route sees early  success, seeks longevity</strong> <br />

<p>The  pilot program for a new off-campus bus route made its debut Thursday night and  was a definite success with students... &quot;I think the real test will be  whether Campus Services and Student Affairs are willing to put their money in,  because obviously students want it,&quot; the Duke Student Government's vice  president said.</p>
<p><strong>Column: With all deliberate  speed</strong> <br />
  (Duke Chronicle, 23 January 2007)</p>
<p>Following  last week's announcement of a settlement between the University and  neighborhood groups -- not to mention City Council's approval of our request to  rezone Central Campus -- students are getting their first opportunity to process  Durhamites' demands... Although the regulatory path has now been cleared for  the 70-year, mega-million dollar reconstruction plan that will transform the  campus, I fear that administrators have compromised students' needs. In  particular, we will live to regret our capitulation to strict caps on retail  development. </p>
<p>In  order to win regulatory approval, the University had to agree to limit public  retail space to 50,000 square feet, 20,000 of which will be transferred from  existing stores on West Campus. That means that Duke's new 128-acre, 1,200-bed  community must make do with an effective increase of just 30,000 square  feet-approximately the size of an Eckerd's drug store... It's hard to conclude  that administrators have done an adequate job of weighing our needs...</p>

<p><strong>Durham</strong><strong> gives nod to  new Central: Vote praised as victory for Duke, city</strong> <br />
  (Duke Chronicle, 17 January 2007)</p>
<p>To  placate fears, University officials agreed that total retail space open to both  University and local customers would not exceed 50,000 square feet, and that no  single retail or restaurant space would exceed 20,000 square feet.</p>
<p>Restrictions  on the height of new buildings, buffer space adjacent to non-University-owned  properties and protection for historic buildings were also guaranteed by  University officials.</p>
<p>&quot;Today  we celebrate a victory for Durham,&quot;  Schelp said. &quot;We have been able to help Duke help itself become a better  neighbor.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Council permits Duke  rezoning</strong> <br />
  (Herald-Sun, 17 January 2007)</p>
<p>The  vote came after Duke officials and the leaders of a &quot;stakeholders  group&quot; of neighboring merchants and homeowners told the council that they  had reached agreement on a set of 12 conditions that will govern the  university's development.</p>
<p>The  leaders of the stakeholders group, John  Schelp of the Old West Durham Neighborhood  Association and Tom Miller  of the Watts Hospital-Hillandale Neighborhood Association, joined Duke University   Provost Peter&nbsp;Lange Tuesday in asking the council to  approve the rezoning.</p>
<p>Schelp  called the agreement a victory for [neighbors and merchants near campus,] Duke  &quot;and all of Durham,&quot; and said neighbors would keep an eye on the  implementation of the retail condition, which is meant to protect merchants on  Ninth Street from competition from campus-based retailers who benefit from  Duke's exemption from property taxes.</p>
<p>Duke's  path to approval did hit some bumps along the way, most notably last summer  when leaders of the private school coupled their rezoning application to a  largely-blank set of drawings that omitted details&nbsp;about the Central  Campus development.</p>
<p><strong>Council OKs Central Campus</strong> <br />
  (News &amp; Observer, 17 January 2007)</p>
<p>The  7-0 vote came after the university made several key concessions to appease  critics from nearby neighborhoods.</p>
<p>University  officials agreed to a dozen legally binding conditions that will limit the  height of future buildings, curtail the amount of retail&nbsp;space, require  the planting of bigger trees and other concessions.</p>
<p>&quot;A  Congolese proverb says: 'No matter how long the night, the day is sure to  come,' &quot; said Old West Durham Neighborhood Association President John  Schelp, who until about two weeks ago had opposed Duke's rezoning. &quot;Well,  the day has finally come. After a long, oftentimes difficult journey, we have  reached agreement on all 12 committed elements, and we support Duke's rezoning  case.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Peace (mostly) rules on  Central Campus</strong> <br />
  (News &amp; Observer, 10 January 2007)</p>
<p>&quot;We've  finally broken through the Gothic ceiling,&quot; said John Schelp,  a neighborhood advocate... In a rezoning proposal set to go before the City  Council on Tuesday, Duke officials have agreed to build no more than 50,000  square feet of new restaurants and shops on the expanse between East and West  campuses&nbsp;that would be open to Duke customers and others... </p>
<p>&quot;They've  already told us here at the Regulator that they're not going to put another  bookstore in as long as we're in business,&quot; Campbell said.  &quot;I have that in writing. The larger issue that saddens me is they  are&nbsp;depriving the students of experiencing Durham  and Durham from  experiencing the students. Clearly, they're trying to provide everything the  students need on campus, and I think that's too bad.&quot;</p>
<p>In  addition to winning retail restrictions, the neighborhood advocates persuaded  Duke to offer 12 of the mill houses in the way of the proposed development free  to anyone willing to move them. Schelp said Duke  also had agreed to put $5,000 toward the move, the same amount it would have  cost to demolish the houses.</p>

<p>Negotiators  for the &quot;stakeholders group&quot; of neighborhood and business interests  &quot;are pleased with the retail&quot; restrictions and believe they will  forestall the development of stores that would compete with off-campus  retailers for the public's business, said John Schelp,  president of the Old West Durham Neighborhood Association.</p>
<p>City  Councilman Mike   Woodard -- who says he has support  for his stance from four other council members, more than enough to block the  rezoning -- responded with a lengthy explanation why the height limit in the  ordinance isn't right for the Erwin/Anderson intersection.

<p>If Duke discussed the details of its Central Campus rezoning  with the community back in the spring, we wouldn't be in the middle of this  rezoning drama now. Instead, Duke submitted a mostly  blank development plan&mdash;ignoring three years of input from the community... We  all have a vested interest in the successful redevelopment of Central  Campus&mdash;and in healthy businesses and neighborhoods in Durham. Hopefully, we can walk into City  Council chambers with an agreement in January. But we certainly didn't need to  wade through this three-year mess to get here.</p>

  (News &amp; Observer, 6 December 2006)</p>
<p>ABC's  made-for-TV teardown in Raleigh  may create an hour of great television, but it's certainly not good for the  neighborhood. Nor is an extreme makeover necessarily the best long-term  financial value for the house's owners.</p>
<p>The  adage &quot;they don't build 'em like they used to&quot; is so true. New  houses, unless they are custom built, are constructed of far inferior materials  than those found in older homes. Plaster and wood are significantly better  products than sheetrock, vinyl and glued-up wood products. The old material has  better energy and sound insulation qualities than the new.

  (Independent Weekly, 6 December 2006)</p>
<p>[Duke  PR chief John] Burness has  explanations for these and other seemingly suspect actions. The problematic  clause in the $2 million agreement was &quot;lawyer language&quot; he says...  But Burness and other administrators must know that any new disclosure that  looks or smells funny can reinforce old attitudes and undo much more  significant acts of goodwill. That's especially true of Duke, which carries  significant historical baggage rooted in its segregated past and early  isolationism from the city&mdash;in some quarters, as Burness notes, Duke is still  known as &quot;The Plantation.&quot; </p>
<p>Burness  agrees that Duke could always do things better, and  that the benefit of hindsight has revealed some of how that can be  accomplished... &quot;When you're as large an entity as Duke  is, people are going to take potshots at you.&quot;</p>
<p>On  the other hand, maybe those potshots would be fewer and farther between if Duke took greater pains not to provide the ammunition.</p>

<p>The  Regulator, its owners say, is &quot;where you are likely to be surprised by a  book, a conversation, an author, or a chance meeting with a friend.&quot; For  30 years, The Regulator has been providing those surprises by the score to  Durhamites and to visitors who come to visit or just stumble happily upon the  shop on Ninth Street. </p>
<p>Started  by self-described ex- &quot;'60s hippies&quot; in the front of a building that  housed a printshop in 1976, the store has expanded twice. Along with the nearby  Magnolia Grill, which celebrated its own 25th anniversary this year, The  Regulator was one of the first anchors of what has become the Ninth Street  shopping-restaurant district treasured by so many. </p>

<p>The  day dawned cold with a promise of snow flurries --Dec. 4, 1976, when The  Regulator Bookshop opened on Durham's  Ninth Street.  The retail climate there seemed cold, too, maybe too cold for a bookstore. Two  grills and other shops catered to workers at nearby Erwin Mills. </p>

<p><strong>Buy into the gifts that keep  on giving ... to Durham</strong>&nbsp;<br />
  (Durham News, 2 December 2006)</p>
<p>If  all of your shopping takes place at national chains, it might dampen your  Christmas spirit to learn that of every $100 you spend, all but 14 bucks has  left Durham,  much of it swelling the pockets of corporate board members and shareholders.  These folks aren't shouldering our local tax burden; instead they treat Durham as a colony to  fleece... On the other hand, nearly a dozen studies show that for every $100  you spend at locally owned businesses, as many as 45 to 68 of your dollars stay  in Durham, depending on the type of business. That's 31 to 54 percent more of  your $100 building a better Durham.</p>
<p>We're  not dogmatic about shopping locally, but we do get tires at Ingold's or Durham  Tire, lumber at Talbert's Building Supply, hardware at Public Hardware, bird  feeders and birdhouses at The Outdoor Bird Co., toys at The Playhouse, books,  cards and magazines at the Regulator Bookshop, gifts at Zola Craft Gallery...</p>
<p><strong>Column: Uncle Moneybags  (theater/Central Campus deal)</strong> <br />
  (Duke Chronicle, 1 December 2006)</p>
<p>Despite  tepid legal assurances, councilman Thomas Stith-the  lone dissenter in the 5-1 vote-called the deal &quot;quid pro quo.&quot; Angry Durham residents also  chimed in, denouncing the deal as &quot;bribery,&quot; &quot;criminal&quot; and  a &quot;boondoggle.&quot;</p>
<p>At  this juncture, it's hard to disagree with them. This &quot;gift&quot; was a  blatant attempt to evade the zoning wars that have plagued other phases of the  Central Campus reconstruction plan... </p>
<p>So,  Duke administrators, it's time to face the facts. The millions of dollars  you've frittered away in the form of payoffs, &quot;donations,&quot;  &quot;contributions&quot; and other financial transactions all add up to one  thing: Duke behaves more like a sugar daddy than a  partner these days...</p>
<p>Once  upon a time on Ninth Street (News &amp; Observer, 28 November 2006)&nbsp;Tom Campbell  begins the story like this: A small and perhaps improbable bookstore opens its  doors for the first time on a cold Saturday morning. It's early in December  1976. There's a vague memory of snow flurries in the air... This Saturday, Campbell and co-owner John Valentine  will host a celebration of the store's 30th anniversary. The eclectic bookshop,  on busy Ninth Street,  has been a gathering place for the community, a place to browse and shop for  books in private and espouse ideas in public.</p>
<p>&quot;It  almost defines Ninth Street...  You can find any good food to eat from hot dogs to pizza to Mexican food. Ninth Street was...  a ruralized funky city. It had a little bit of country feel with its sculptured  frogs and Indian clothing shop. The bookstore was the intellectual center of  all of that.

<p>There's  no question that Ninth Street  has a unique character that needs protecting.

<p><strong>Clause is hitch in Duke  deal: Rezoning tied to Durham  donation</strong> <br />
  (News &amp; Observer, 13 November 2006)</p>
<p>&quot;Even  if the city reserved the right to turn down the rezoning or the site plan  approval, the fact that there's $1.5 million that's out there contingent upon  approval, I think would pose a significant legal&nbsp;problem,&quot; said UNC  professor David Owens, who holds degrees in law and planning and who has  written books on North Carolina's land-use and zoning laws.</p>

  (Herald-Sun, 8 November 2006)</p>
<p>Just  because we really want a new theater doesn't mean we should make a foolish deal  in order to get it, which is what City Council did Monday. </p>
<p>Council  unanimously voted for a &quot;quid pro quo,&quot; which is Latin, loosely, for  &quot;something for something.&quot; The something City Council gets is a $1.5  million donation from Duke   University, the last  piece of funding needed for the theater. What Duke  wants in exchange is a favorable vote on its plans for Anderson Street, which will become the  main road through the renovated Central Campus... </p>
<p>The  problem is that governments can't do quid pro quos, for obvious reasons. The  deliberative process must be free from influence, especially the kind that can  be purchased with a large check. </p>
<p><strong>Theater plan OK'd, strings  attached</strong>&nbsp;<br />
  (Herald-Sun, 7 November 2006)</p>
<p>Brushing  aside complaints about the appearance of a quid pro quo, the City Council voted  Monday to green-light construction of a long-planned downtown performing arts  center and apply to the project an extra $2 million donated by Duke University. </p>
<p>&quot;If  Durham accepts the terms of Duke's offer, undue pressure will be placed on  seeing through Duke's desires with less attention paid on having a fair and  comprehensive review of the proposal that takes into&nbsp;account other  potential impacts on nearby business districts,&quot; Broad Street resident and  Duke alumnus Joel Sholtes said in an e-mail to the council&nbsp;Monday  afternoon. &quot;How can Durham  fairly assess Duke's proposal with a contingent $1.5 million hanging in the  air?&quot; </p>
<p><strong>Stage is set for center: The  Durham City Council approves the performing  arts plan</strong> <br />
  (News &amp; Observer, 7 November 2006)</p>
<p>Under  the agreement approved Monday, Duke will immediately  write the city a $500,000 check. The remaining $1.5 million will be granted  only&nbsp;upon the city's approval of Duke's Anderson Street plan and &quot;any other  necessary approvals required by the city for Duke to undertake the  improvements.&quot; Some who have criticized the arrangement see that phrase as  a direct reference to the Central Campus rezoning... It is illegal under state  law for a local government to accept money in exchange for granting regulatory  approval. </p>
<p>John Schelp, the president of the Old  West Neighborhood Association, said Monday's vote had effectively signaled to  future developers the price for which the Durham City Council can be bought.</p>
<p>&quot;This  will be a dark cloud over the Central Campus rezoning from here on out,&quot;  Schelp said. &quot;This is clearly something for something. Duke  was brazen enough to put it in writing.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Duke</strong><strong> sticks to Central Campus retail figure</strong> <br />
(Herald-Sun, 6 November 2006)</p>
<p>The  university's new proposal drew a cautious response from Tom Miller,  a Watts Hospital-Hillandale neighborhood activist who's been one of the two  point men for the merchant/neighbor &quot;stakeholders coalition&quot; that's  pressed Duke for limits... Miller said neighbors and  merchants are worried more about retail on Central than they've been about it  on either West Campus or East Campus because Central will be more accessible to  passers-by than are spaces like those at the Bryan Center. </p>
<p>&quot;One  has to wonder if Duke is just paying lip service for  public consumption and doesn't really want to reach an agreement with neighbors  and merchants,&quot; Schelp said in an email. </p>
<p>&quot;Whether  the theater deal is put into writing or just left hanging in the air, Duke has told us what it wants,&quot; the Old West Durham  board said in a letter to the council. &quot;We certainly don't want to set bad  precedents regarding the transparency of local governance here in Durham.

<p>A  number of City Council members have raised objections over the &quot;quid pro  quo&quot; nature of the gift and the timing of the donation, which also comes  before the council's vote on the University's Central Campus rezoning  proposal-slated for November or December.</p>
<p>The  Anderson Street  issue has nothing to do with the arts center plans, said John Burness,  senior vice president for public affairs and government relations.</p>
<p>Woodard  and Brown, along with City Council members Thomas  Stith and Diane Catotti,  have also expressed concerns over the link between the Anderson Street proposal and the pending  council vote that would allow Central Campus to be rezoned from residential to  university-college classification.</p>
<p><strong>Editorial: Theater donation  deal is a bad idea</strong> <br />
  (Herald-Sun, 31 October 2006)</p>
<p>Now,  after time has passed and the idea has been further discussed, we believe it's  even more clear that this is a bad idea. As a matter of fact, it's hard to  understand why anyone ever thought it was a good idea.</p>
<p>Now  that these concepts have been linked, it will be hard to disconnect them. But  Duke and City Council need to try. Duke should untie  all the strings from the deal, and the City Council should assure the public  that its review of Central Campus will be rigorous and unrelated to the  theater. </p>

<p>Woodard's  comments made him the fourth council member, joining colleagues Thomas Stith, Diane Catotti and Eugene Brown,  to voice qualms about whether the juxtaposition of the $2 million donation with  the rezoning passes what Stith has termed &quot;the common-sense smell  test.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;In  talking with local lawyers, they've called this 'Milk-Bone money' -- where  Durham has to sit up and beg for Duke's money,&quot; John Schelp, an Old West  Durham Neighborhood Association activist who's been involved in talks with the  university about the rezoning, said in an e-mail to the council. &quot;This  deal is darn close to quid pro quo -- and can have a chilling effect on the  regulatory function of the city and the legislative function of the  council.&quot; </p>

At times, his  commitment to the neighborhood has even put him at odds with the Duke  administration... &quot;We can affect change in this town,&quot; he explained.  &quot;Part of that is because Duke balances out the  business community, which gives the neighborhoods a voice [in community  affairs].&quot;</p>
<p>In  his tenure as OWDNA president, Schelp has already collaborated with Duke  several times, including on the defeat of the proposed asphalt plant in East Durham that would have significantly lowered  residents' standard of living...

<p>Community  members have reacted strongly to Duke's Pedestrian Plan, saying Duke  is not currently doing enough to correct the inferior pedestrian facilities.</p>

<p><strong>Planners' advice: No Duke  rezoning</strong> <br />
  (Herald-Sun, 11 October 2006) </p>
<p>Voicing  dissatisfaction with Duke   University's promises  about retail development on campus, the Durham Planning Commission recommended  Tuesday&nbsp;night that the City Council reject a proposed rezoning of the  school's Central Campus. </p>
<p>The  7-4 vote came after neighborhood leaders and the managing partner of Northgate  Mall said Duke hadn't gone far enough to guard  against the possibility that the 128-acre Central Campus redevelopment  would&nbsp;undercut private-sector businesses. </p>
<p><strong>Advisory body opposes  Central Campus plan</strong> <br />
  (News &amp; Observer, 11 October 2006)</p>
<p>The  city's planning commission, a panel that advises the City Council on land-use  and development issues, voted 7 to 4 to recommend rejection of the rezoning  proposal.</p>
<p>&quot;I  don't believe a university ought to be in the business of running a shopping  center,&quot; said Caleb Southern, a  planning commission member.</p>
<p>&quot;The  mission of the university is education. Retail shouldn't be the mission,&quot;  Schelp said.</p>

<p><strong>Letter: Ask Duke questions</strong> <br />
  (Herald-Sun, 10 October 2006)</p>
<p>If Duke envisages a significant increase of total retail space  on the remodeled Central Campus, this will have to involve targeting a larger  market, meaning Durham  residents. Or else Duke will need a massive increase  in the size of its student body. </p>
<p>If Duke is going to have to target this larger Durham market as a matter of simple economic  sense, the merchants on nearby Ninth    Street need to start asking some hard questions. </p>
<p><strong>Letter: Duke  gives runaround on new central campus</strong> <br />
  (Herald-Sun, 10 October 2006)</p>
<p>&nbsp;As  a taxpayer and local merchant I am just outraged at the runaround Durham and its citizens are receiving from Duke University  regarding the rezoning of Central Campus. After nearly four years of  stonewalling, Duke's rezoning request at tonight's Planning Commission will  allow the university to build any number of 20,000 square-foot stores on  campus. </p>
<p>As  presented today, Duke's request has the potential of undermining local business  for miles (this is not just about Ninth Street) while lining their own tax  exempt pockets... I hope the days of Duke calling the shots in Durham are over and the Planning Commission  will send Duke back to the table to negotiate  honorably with the community stakeholders who've been working on these issues. </p>
<p><strong>Letter: Duke's sidewalk plan  inadequate</strong> <br />
  (Duke Chronicle, 2 October 2006)</p>
<p>The  Pedestrian Plan that Duke recently submitted to Durham's Development  Review Board for approval is woefully inadequate. Duke's plan leaves off a  significant number of future sidewalks-which gives the University a pass on  sidewalk requirements outlined in Durham's  ordinance.</p>
<p>In  public hearings, Duke has repeatedly affirmed the  importance of sidewalks and pedestrian connectivity. A review of its pedestrian  plan suggests that talk is cheap... According to local officials, Duke seems to be working behind the scenes to avoid building  sidewalks near its projects. </p>
<p>Instead  of trying to save money, Duke should create a safer  environment for students, visitors, fans and neighbors. Instead of scaling back  their commitments to sidewalks, Duke should be  working even harder to build better, pedestrian-friendly bridges with Durham.</p>

<p>Spilling  from Ninth Street  to the Duke East Campus and attracting an estimated several thousand people  from around the state and beyond, Saturday's Gay Pride Parade meant different  things to different people, depending on the particular perspectives and life  experiences they brought to it. </p>
<p>One  goal of Saturday's event was to build bridges to the non-gay community, Hayes said. He was encouraged by the fact that more than 20 Ninth Street  businesses displayed &quot;gay-friendly&quot; logos in their windows. </p>

<p>More  than 600 people in northwest Durham  are on the listserve. If a resident sees something suspicious, everyone may soon  learn about it. Residents still meet with each other once a month to share  concerns. Durham  police and the community watch group are using the same e-mail system, and both  are helping each other. [PAC2, Durham's  first PAC listserve, was started by OWDNA's Pam Spaulding.]</p>
<p><strong>Duke</strong><strong> focuses on neighbor relations</strong> <br />
  (Herald-Sun, 13 August 2006)</p>
<p>There's  a guarded optimism among Duke   University  administrators, student leaders and even beleaguered neighbors who have endured  hard-partying students that efforts to curb loutish behavior may start to bear  fruit this year. </p>
<p>Kelly Jarrett, vice president of the Old  West Durham Neighborhood Association, is taking a positive attitude to the  return of students... &quot;I really hope the positive stuff is what shines the  next couple of weeks,&quot; she said. &quot;There certainly was no place to go  but up after last spring.&quot; </p>
<p><strong>Vehicle strikes, injures  woman: Safety of Durham street  under review <br />
</strong>(News &amp;  Observer, 12 August 2006)</p>
<p>A Duke University  student was hit and run over by a large sport utility vehicle around lunchtime  Friday outside a busy shopping center on Broad Street... The woman is expected to  survive, but the incident is a symptom of unsafe sidewalks and walkways on Broad Street that  some residents have repeatedly appealed to the city to improve.</p>
<p>The  Old West Durham Neighborhood Association which includes the Bull Market shopping center and businesses along Ninth Street, says  several merchants have long lobbied for safer walkways in the area... They say  the speed limit should be lowered from 35 mph to 25 mph, and sidewalks need to  be added at the intersection of Markham  and Broad, where a Durham   Academy teacher was hit  and killed by a bus in 2004. </p>
<p><strong>It's official: Hunt headed to Hall</strong> <br />
  (Herald-Sun, 10 August 2006)&nbsp; </p>
<p>&quot;And  the people who came to see the game were just local people, from close by, but  that game was important to them. They got their popcorn and a drink and had a  good time,&quot; [West Durham native] Tommy Hunt  said. &quot;It's nothing fancy, but that's where it all starts. </p>
<p>&quot;Everybody  starts out on a little field with some wire around it, maybe 50 seats in the  bleachers and one water bucket. That's the beginning, the grassroots, and to  me, that's the level that's the most important.&quot; </p>
<p>For  that reason, Hunt said he feels especially honored  to be selected as one of six inductees to the N.C. High School Athletic  Association Hall of Fame. </p>
<p><strong>Police urge marking of  valuables</strong>&nbsp; <br />
  (Herald-Sun, 10 August 2006)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>In  light of what police are calling &quot;a recent rash&quot; of break-ins and  larcenies in Old North Durham, Duke Park and Old West Durham, crime prevention  officers are urging residents to mark their valuables. </p>
<p>&quot;I  would encourage property owners to have serial numbers [of items like  electronics] recorded, and mark tools with an electronic etcher,&quot; said Master Officer Eric Hester in a posting Tuesday to the Old  West Durham listserve. </p>
<p><strong>Editorial: Ninth Street's  future</strong>&nbsp; <br />
  (Herald-Sun, 9 August 2006)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Ninth Street's small but vibrant  business district has long been one of Durham's  gems. It is a source of both pride and sustenance to locals and it is a  destination for visitors, underscored by the fact its exit is clearly marked on  the Durham Freeway. </p>
<p>The  Web site of the Ninth Street Merchants Association sums up the area's appeal:  &quot;Ninth Street  is a pedestrian-friendly, old-fashioned shopping neighborhood,&quot; the  association says. &quot;Located two blocks from Duke University's  East Campus in the Old West Durham neighborhood, Ninth Street offers an exceptional blend  of locally owned specialty shops.&quot; </p>

<p>The  Old West Durham Neighborhood Association is likely to want to discuss business  development. Its president, John   Schelp, said members always have  regarded Green Street  as the proper &quot;firewall for commercial creep,&quot; though they wouldn't  mind seeing more business along Iredell    Street, Perry    Street and west Markham Avenue. </p>
<p>Activists  also want to see the installation of a short sidewalk connecting Ninth Street  to East Campus along Markham Avenue,  Schelp said, noting that four pedestrians in that area have been hit by  vehicles, one fatally. </p>

<p>E.K. Powe students  have often asked art teacher Malcolm   Goff for art supplies and brought  him artwork they had completed at their homes. So three years ago, Goff started  the program to cultivate that creative energy.</p>
<p>About  200 children signed up last year. Students work on their art at home, and to  advance they must complete a series of art and community-service challenges. </p>
<p><strong>Duke</strong><strong> should fill in details of project: Councilman wants more  information on Central Campus&nbsp; <br />
</strong>(Herald-Sun,  28 July 2006) </p>
<p>Durham  City Councilman Thomas Stith says Duke   University should give  regulators more details about the Central Campus redevelopment than it has so  far before he and his colleagues vote on a 128-acre rezoning that would  facilitate the project... </p>
<p>The  development plan Duke has submitted to back its request to apply university and  college zoning to the Central Campus area is mostly blank... Schelp, president  of the Old West Durham Neighborhood Association, said that he's glad to see  council members speaking up in public, given that several have voiced questions  behind the scenes. </p>
<p><strong>Editorial: Central Campus  details are needed</strong> <br />
  (Herald-Sun, 28 July 2006)&nbsp;&nbsp; It makes  abundant sense that the community should be interested in what happens in the  redevelopment of 128 acres of Duke's Central Campus. </p>
<p>Duke has requested a zoning change to university and college  designation for the site, but the plans it has submitted to the City/County  Planning Department are mostly a blank slate...</p>
<p>In  a Thursday article by The Herald-Sun's Ray  Gronberg, Councilwoman Diane  Catotti matched the tone set by fellow members Thomas Stith and Mike Woodard.  &quot;In general, the more detail the better,&quot; she said. &quot;And I have  a history of trying to work out stuff and trying to get as many committed  elements [in rezoning cases as possible.]&quot; </p>
<p>Working  stuff out is good. For their parts, neighborhood activists John Schelp  and Tom Miller also seem willing to help work  things out.</p>
<p><strong>Buzz: As page turns on Ninth Street, caf&eacute;  ready to expand</strong> <br />

<p>As  part of its pending closing, the used bookstore is selling its 4-foot-by-6-foot  bookcases. Take note there are only a few left. Books that aren't sold will be  shipped to owner John   Browner's new venture, an  English-language secondhand bookstore called The Munich Readery in Munich, Germany. </p>
<p>Meanwhile,  the owners of Blue Corn Caf&eacute;, are planning on doubling the size of their  restaurant, which has been serving up pan-Latin cuisine for almost 10 years.</p>

<p>On Dec. 16, 2004,  the Durham Fire Department's Squad Company 2 [Ninth Street Station] responded  to a house fire at 309 Bobs Lane.  Part of the roof had collapsed and a man was trapped inside. </p>

<p><strong>Frosh get $50 to spend at  local eateries</strong> <br />
  (Duke Chronicle, 19 July 2006)</p>
<p>Duke Student Government President Elliott Wolf said he hopes the program  is the beginning of what is to come. &quot;This program only has value in as  much as it is going to be expanded... We aren't satisfied with this limited  fashion,&quot; Wolf said.</p>
<p>On  an online town-gown listserve, some residents criticized the University for not  taking a bolder action... &quot;Both UNC and NC State have liberal student card  policies that do not penalize students for spending off campus and that do not  have exorbitant set-up costs for participating merchants,&quot; Durham resident  Kelly Jarrett wrote. &quot;When will Duke follow  suit?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Editorial: Mr. McDonald's  legacy</strong> <br />
  (Herald-Sun, 12 July 2006)</p>
<p>Southern  Living, in a piece on Durham's Ninth Street shopping district in March 1999,  rhapsodized about an institution familiar to generations here... &quot;There is  one mandatory stop on Ninth Street:  McDonald's Drug Store,&quot; the magazine asserted.  &quot;And a mandatory purchase too: a delicious malted milk shake whipped up at  the old soda fountain. Sit sip, and refresh at the counter, look out the window  at fellow shoppers, and then hit the pavement again.&quot; </p>
<p>Age  and ill health closed down that &quot;mandatory stop&quot; over a year ago, but  memories of what it has meant to Durham  came flooding back with the sad news last week of longtime owner John McDonald's  death. </p>

<p>&quot;Duke  needs to provide a much more detailed plan,&quot; said John Schelp  of the Old West Durham  Neighborhood Association. &quot;What they've submitted is mostly blank... We  know they know what the issues are. We know we can talk with them because we've  worked with them in the past.&quot;</p>

  (Herald-Sun, 11 July 2006)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>The  president of the Old West Durham Neighborhood Association said that he and  other activists were concerned because they were &quot;surprised to see how  little of what&quot; they've discussed with the university in recent months  made it onto the largely-blank development plan Duke filed in support of its  rezoning request. </p>
<p>Schelp  added that neighbors were pleased that Duke seemed  to be backing away from the possibility of asking a major retailer like Barnes  &amp; Noble or Borders to run a campus bookstore on the site, but would  &quot;like to see it in writing.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Delay proposed on Duke  rezoning <br />
</strong>(News &amp;  Observer, 11 July 2006)</p>
<p>Over  the past two and a half years, neighborhood advocates and merchants have raised  concerns about new campus retail that could pull customers away from homegrown Ninth Street  businesses. They also have pushed Duke to protect environmentally sensitive  streambed hollows.</p>
<p>In  their letter, neighborhood advocates said they want to see maps and notes  designate more natural areas and open space... They also want rules that would  protect the location and appearance of the historic homes in the proposed  district. </p>

<p>&quot;Nothing  surprises me with Duke,&quot; he said. &quot;This happens a lot. Duke  has all these community meetings where they tell us what they're going to do,  take questions, and say, 'We'll get back to you.' That's not a conversation  with partners. That's a lecture in the classroom with teacher and student. But  we recognize that Duke does it its way, and we move  forward.&quot; </p>

<p>Others  said the gift, while welcome, aren't a substitute for reforms by Duke to  student spending accounts or meal plans that would make it more convenient for  students to patronize off-campus dining and other services throughout the year. </p>
<p>&quot;This  is a nice gesture, but it's only a gesture,&quot; said John Schelp,  president of the Old West Durham Neighborhood Association. &quot;They assured  us they are going to expand the DukeCard to off-campus, and we're looking  forward to seeing the details of that expansion.&quot; </p>

This is not expanding the Duke Card. This is a  crumb.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>The Regulator Is on a Roll</strong>&nbsp; <br />
  (American Booksellers Association, June 2006)</p>
<p>Last  week, Duke University  decided to halt plans to build a new, large bookstore on its campus as part of  a $240 million campus redevelopment project, Regulator's Campbell reported  to Bookselling This Week... Under the plan, the current textbook and trade book  stores would have been rolled into a much larger bookstore located at the  corner of the main intersection of the new development in a three-story  building. At a pubic meeting in March, Duke Provost Peter Lange  would not rule out that a chain such as Barnes &amp; Noble or Borders would run  the bookstore. </p>
<p>While  Duke officials did not provide him with a reason for the change in plans  regarding the bookstore, Campbell speculated that university  officials may have been worried that the new store would have faced community  opposition. Certainly, a number of residents voiced their concerns over the  proposed bookstore at the March meeting, according to the Durham's Herald-Sun. </p>

<p><strong>Editorial: Consider  neighborhoods</strong>&nbsp; <br />
  (Herald-Sun, 26 May 2006)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>We  were encouraged this week to hear City Council members call for the city to  develop a fund to help spur economic development in struggling neighborhoods  near downtown. A similar fund for the downtown area has been instrumental in  fueling the success we see there today. It is important as we go forward for  city leaders to pay more attention to neighborhood development. Pouring  millions into downtown revitalization while ignoring surrounding neighborhoods  wouldn't be a smart move. If left unchecked, crime and blight from nearby  neighborhoods will eventually spill over to downtown to spoil the significant  public and private investments made there... The time to invest in Durham's neighborhoods is  now. </p>

<p><strong>What I love about Durham: The readers write</strong> <br />
  (Independent Weekly, 24 May 2006)</p>
<p>Some  of the things I love most about Durham  are things we take the most heat for in the media. What the media often  represents as squabbling, in-fighting, special-interest politics and government  ineptitude I see as open and accessible local government and diverse citizens  who care deeply about and participate actively in local political and community  affairs. What the media represents as racial discord I see as the healthy  conflicts and disagreements that arise when the diverse groups that make Durham home work through  issues together for the good of the entire community. While the media often  represents Durham as gritty and crime-ridden, I  see strong, organized, vocal communities of people who love their neighbors and  their neighborhoods and work together to make all of Durham a better place. --Kelly Jarrett  [OWDNA vice president]</p>
<p><strong>Column: Duke  tries to shift the blame</strong> <br />
  (Herald-Sun, 16 May 2006)</p>
<p>The  Bowen-Chambers report does reach a very important conclusion: &quot;it is a  mistake to have responsibility for Duke outreach efforts into the community  overseen by the Vice President for Public Affairs. The effect, as one person  put it, is to think of everthing Duke does as  motivated by PR concerns rather than by a genuine interest in the welfare of  the community.&quot; The sooner President Brodhead moves the Neighborhood  Partnership Initiative out of Duke's PR office the better.</p>
<p><strong>Barnes &amp; Noble on the  way?</strong> <br />
  (Duke Towerview,  Spring 2006)</p>
<p>The  Old West Durham Neighborhood Association, has been circulating an email since  March about the possibility of a Barnes &amp; Noble bookstore opening shop on  Central Campus. &quot;...We'd like to convey to you as clearly as we can that  we consider the possibility (no matter how remote), of Duke making arrangements  with a Barnes &amp; Noble to run a campus book store as a matter of grave  concern,&quot; the group wrote in a March 22 email to President Richard  Brodhead and Provost Peter Lange.</p>
<p>&quot;Forget  for a moment that the Barnes &amp; Nobel wouldn't have to pay property taxes  and would, therefore, hold a clear advantage over the Regulator Bookshop. Over  the past three years, Duke officials have repeatedly said they'd do nothing to  undermine Ninth Street.  The fact that Duke is even thinking about a Barnes  &amp; Noble that's a quarter of a mile from The Regulator says otherwise.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;We're  not talking about replicating the Southpoint Barnes  &amp; Noble... I doubt the name would even be on the building,&quot; said Duke Executive Vice President Tallman   Trask.</p>
<p><strong>Letter: Duke's spin <br />
</strong>(News &amp;  Observer, 13 May 2006)</p>
<p>Unfortunately,  shifting blame is a common weapon in Duke's spin control arsenal: When trouble  arises, Duke will protect its own image by blaming  its problems on Durham  officials and citizens.</p>
<p>The  problems that such spin control present for town-gown relations were stated in  the recently released Bowen-Chambers report: having Duke's community outreach  under the umbrella of Public Affairs makes it seem that &quot;everything Duke does is motivated by PR concerns rather than by a  genuine interest in the welfare of the community.&quot; The sooner President Richard Brodhead moves the Neighborhood  Partnership Initiative out of Duke's PR office, the sooner Durham will become a true partner and not a  PR pawn.</p>

<p>Study:  Duke contributes $3.2B to Durham (Duke Chronicle, 21 April 2006)</p>
<p>&quot;This  was ready to go about a month ago, but we were reluctant to issue it as it  could be seen as strictly a means to do PR,&quot; Burness said.</p>
<p>&quot;Hopefully,  the University will recognize the generous contributions of the Durham community when Trinity College  was struggling to stay afloat in 1892,&quot; Schelp wrote in an e-mail.  &quot;Had it not been for the generous donations of money and free land...  there would be no Duke   University today,&quot;  he said.</p>
<p>Romand Coles, associate professor of  political science, praised the University's economic contributions to Durham, but said there  are &quot;blind spots&quot; that must not be overlooked... &quot;What the  report illustrates is that there are many good things about Duke-Durham  relations,&quot; he said. &quot;What is missing is discussion about those  least-paid workers at Duke.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Editorial: Economic impact  still important <br />
</strong>(Duke  Chronicle, 25 April 2006)</p>
<p>And  yes, the timing may appear to be a little suspect. It does happen to be the  only major nugget of positive Duke-Durham news in the past few weeks, and it  comes right in the middle of the first major Duke scandal since the death of Jesica Santillan,  who died as a result of transplant mistakes at Duke Hospital.</p>
<p>We  are aware, however, that an economic boost to a community does not translate  over into healthy relationships in other arenas. Duke and Durham have a long way to go, but be sure to  stop once in a while and appreciate the healthy parts of the relationship. </p>
<p><strong>Column: Modern-day dookies  need a history lesson</strong> <br />
  (Herald-Sun, 21 April 2006)</p>
<p>When  I read of the university's setting up medical practices that compete directly  with those of private physicians, of the university's attempts to create a  commercial center on the Central Campus that will compete with neighboring  Ninth Street shops, of students' parties in Trinity Heights and Trinity Park  neighborhoods that plague their neighbors with noise, alcohol-fueled  misbehavior, and garbage and excrement in nearby yards, I am appalled.</p>
<p>Students  and faculty alike need to learn of Duke's modest beginnings as the  Methodist-run Trinity College in rural Randolph County, of the tiny college's  move to Durham (already a flourishing town, in 1892) that was made possible by  the fruits of hard work in the tobacco and textile industries, and especially  by the generosity of two millionaires, Julian S. Carr and Washington Duke. They  should hear about the extent to which the Dukes and other Durhamites supported  Trinity during its early years in Durham, about the closeness of the town and  the college at that time, and about James B. Duke's 1924 endowment that  transformed the small college into a major university.</p>

  (Chronicle, 20 April 2006)</p>
<p>Make  Central Campus a Model for Duke Social Life and Duke-Durham Relations. Duke's  increasingly monotonous social scene has pushed activities off campus and bred  intense local hostility... If Duke is striving to  create a college-town atmosphere on Central-which it should be-then plopping down  a big box Barnes &amp; Noble would be a disastrous expression of corporate  largesse and insouciance about the local economy. The Regulator is a  family-owned bookstore on 9th    Street with a college-feel, and could expand its  operation in a new facility on Central.</p>
<p><strong>Talkback: PR Tool</strong> <br />
  (Independent Weekly, 19 April 2006)</p>
<p>Duke University should not have used the  neighborhood partnership as a PR tool in its damage control efforts.</p>
<p>Genuine  partners engage in dialogue and express their feelings freely. So long as Duke continues to understand and use partnership  neighborhoods as extensions of its PR office, true and full partnership isn't  possible. And that, it seems, is both the point and the problem with having the  Neighborhood Partnership Initiative located in Duke's PR office. </p>
<p><strong>Editorial: Weighing the pros  and cons</strong> <br />
  (Duke Chronicle, 12 April 2006)</p>
<p>Although  nothing is yet concrete, we applaud the University for looking into a more  liberal meal plan for freshman.</p>
<p>Freshmen  would have expanded options to include off-campus vendors, where the variety  and quality of food is much greater... Giving students an incentive to purchase  food from Ninth Street  vendors brings much-needed business to it... And if freshmen are pouring into Durham, it will mean  safer and better-lit walking areas, a more lively off-campus area and, down the  road, another reason to celebrate the Duke-Durham relationship. At a time when  tensions are running high, valuing that relationship is of particular  importance.</p>
<p><strong>Ninth Street</strong><strong> vendors likely to accept students' food points next  semester&nbsp; <br />
</strong>(Duke  Chronicle, 7 April 2006)</p>
<p>Potential  changes include... expanding the food points system to restaurants on Ninth  Street by next semester, said Jim Wulforst, director of dining services...</p>
<p>Moneta suggested possibly dedicating particular nights at off-campus  restaurants to residents in specific freshman dormitories, which would  encourage students to continue to eat in groups.</p>
<p>Wulforst  noted that although the incoming Class of 2010 is signing up for meal plans under  the current model, they likely will be notified of a change over the summer...  &quot;They could be in for a very nice surprise,&quot; Wulforst said with a  laugh.

We believe  that DDI has a history of using these taxpayer monies to build up downtown at  the expense of other Durham neighborhoods and  that these funds would be better and more fairly spent funding deserving  non-profits that provide services to Durham  citizens.</p>
<p>As  part of its development strategy, DDI actively recruits existing Durham businesses to relocate downtown from other Durham locations, which  DDI staff admitted in a letter to the editor... It's not good public policy to  move businesses from one part of Durham  to another and pretend it's new business recruitment. Nor is it good policy to  move jobs from one part of Durham  to another and pretend it's new job creation. </p>
<p><strong>Letter: Downtown Durham Inc.  outgrew public funding</strong> <br />
  (Herald-Sun, 10 April 2006) </p>
<p>In  my experience sitting on the community review board for city grants... DDI  rated very low on the city's list of goals. </p>
<p>With  its new private sector stakeholders, if DDI opened its boundaries to help  business districts like Old Five Points, and Angier Avenue, its numbers would rise and  it could still score high for public investment.</p>
<p><strong>Case Shakes Duke's Place in  City</strong> <br />
  (Washington  Post, 1 April 2006)</p>
<p>Duke has received low marks for its town-gown relations in Princeton  Review's 2005 student survey... The university could do more to address what Durham Mayor Bill Bell, a Howard University  graduate who grew up in the District, called &quot;moral and ethical issues  below the surface that have now risen to the surface.&quot; Those issues center  around race and class, he said, alluding to reports of racial slurs at the  party and recent stories about black female students at Duke feeling  threatened.</p>
<p>&quot;The  perception is, you have rich kids, predominately white, from very privileged  backgrounds, paying $45,000-plus a year for their education, and they've always  lived in a cocoon,&quot; he said. &quot;And when they get to Duke, they stay in  that cocoon.&quot;</p>
<p>Duke  students behaving badly has been a problem, said neighborhood activist John Schelp, but his own battles with Duke have been  over development disputes. He has fought university efforts to bring extensive  retail services onto Duke's Central Campus, including a Barnes  and Noble and clothing chains.</p>
<p>Schelp,  a 44-year-old Washington native who grew up [near] Georgetown, accuses the university of trying to keep  students out of Durham  and their money on campus. &quot;Since the retail outlets would be tax-exempt,  they have an unfair advantage over locally owned businesses nearby,&quot; he  said.</p>
<p><strong>The Family: How three  homeless men's lives came together in a plastic encampment just off West Main</strong> <br />
  (Independent Weekly, 29 March 2006)</p>
<p>Every  night when the sun goes down in Durham,  three men sit in the woods by the train tracks and try to keep warm. That's Mark,  sitting there cross-legged, splitting sticks for kindling between long draws  from a 40-ounce bottle of malt liquor. Just to his right is Mike, the one who  looks a little like George Carlin, small and wiry, a casual beard, and thin  white hair pulled straight back across his scalp... Now look across from Mike, and that's Concrete, sitting on an upturned  bucket. </p>
<p>Their  shelter is tucked into a blind of cleared woodland among the chutes and thicket  that garnish the gravel railway bed looking out onto Main Street in [West] Durham. They lay their heads a stone's throw  from Mad Hatter's, that quietly high-born caf&eacute; that's been gradually annexed as  a de facto Duke conference room and is the cornerstone of a shopping center for  young and affluent Durhamites featuring franchises known for their wholesome  corporate citizenry: Ben and Jerry's, Whole Foods. </p>
<p><strong>Letter: No to Barnes &amp; Noble</strong> <br />
  (Herald-Sun, 28 March 2006)&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't see  that the sale of merchandise pertaining primarily to Duke University classes  and paraphernalia, which was the original claim of President Brodhead and Peter  Lange, would be in the market plan of a big franchise like Barnes &amp; Noble  and its stockholders -- certainly not in the long term... I implore those  higher minds at Duke to consult their social consciences and their obligations  to their community. </p>
<p><strong>Letter: Barnes &amp; Noble  should be off the table for Duke</strong> <br />
  (Herald-Sun, 28 March 2006)&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>The  board of the Old West Durham Neighborhood Association asks Tallman Trask  and Duke to keep their promises to the Durham  community... Actions, as the saying goes, speak louder than words. We ask Duke  to take the unneighborly act of bringing a national chain bookstore to Central  Campus off the table.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Letter: To be  fair, pay taxes (Herald-Sun, 28 March 2006)&nbsp;&nbsp;  Now Trask is back to trying to open a Barnes &amp; Noble, property  tax-free, down the block from Durham's best independent bookstore.  (Remonstrations about &quot;fair competition&quot; should be laughed off.  Before you start talking about fair, start paying taxes like everyone else.) </p>
<p>Trask's  brazen attempts to exploit Duke's non-profit status to abuse Durham's retail market, without any  consultation with the faculty, continue to degrade Duke's standing as an  institution that exists for something other than its own promotion. As a former  employee, student and current neighbor of Duke, I am weary of Trask's  malfeasance. Enough is enough. </p>
<p><strong>Duke Plans Raise Concern for  Regulator Bookshop</strong>&nbsp; <br />
  (American Booksellers Association, 28 March 2006)</p>
<p>At  the public meeting, a number of residents voiced concern over the effect a book  so close to Regulator would have. John Schelp,  president of the Old West Durham Neighborhood Association, said the prospect  raised red flags, the Herald-Sun reported... The Regulator's Tom Campbell  added that it was ironic that a university could potentially be in the  &quot;position of destroying a major cultural resource in its community by  creating a huge bookstore and moving it to the edge of its campus.&quot;</p>
<p>It  is clear, however, that many in the Durham  community are staunch supporters of The Regulator, Campbell said.  &quot;One option is to organize our various communities to oppose the  bookstore.... People in the neighborhood, [some] Duke professors, and people  who shop here have said if you need help opposing this new bookstore to let  them know.&quot;</p>

  (Preservation Durham,  Spring 2006)</p>
<p>In  another sold-out Lunch &amp; Learn, long-time Old West Durham residents Wayne Smith, Elizabeth Utley, Mary Coles, Dan Wiley, and Holly Hall  told stories of life in a cotton mill village. We thank Vaguely Reminiscent for  their sponsorship of this program.</p>
<p><strong>Mill</strong><strong> Town</strong><strong> Graves</strong> <br />
  (Matter, Spring 2006)</p>
<p>The  OWDNA organized the first of many cemetery clean-ups in 2000. And from the  overgrown bush emerged a unique picture of our history... There's still a path  cutting through the grounds thanks to the OWDNA... The cemetery has a peaceful  air about it. It feels like a sanctuary from the highway that pokes through the  wisteria. </p>
<p><strong>Duke</strong><strong> gives details of Central Campus: Key concern is how it will  affect Ninth Street</strong> <br />
  (Herald-Sun, 22 March 2006)</p>
<p>Several  of the 40 or so people who attended a meeting near East Campus voiced the same  concern that has cropped up at previous public airings of the development: Will  its retail operations harm nearby Ninth    Street? </p>
<p>Duke Provost Peter   Lange repeated earlier pledges  that Duke has no intention of supplanting  enterprises on Ninth Street  or elsewhere... When questioned by John Schelp,  president of the Old West Durham Neighborhood Association, whether Barnes &amp;  Noble or Borders might run the bookstore, Lange said  &quot;it has been discussed,&quot; and that he &quot;can't exclude&quot; the  possibility. </p>
<p><strong>Neighbors voice concerns  about impact of Central <br />
</strong>(Duke  Chronicle, 22 March 2006)</p>
<p>Taxation  was another controversial topic at the meeting. Because Central Campus is zoned  as a University-College District, any vendors located there would not have to  pay property tax. </p>
<p>Business  owners said this gives on-campus businesses an unfair advantage, but Lange said the University is considering charging vendors  fees comparable to property tax to level the playing field. The fees would be  collected by the University. [Didn't happen.]</p>
<p><strong>Central Campus: Duke previews development plans&nbsp; <br />
</strong>(News &amp;  Observer, 22 March 2006)</p>
<p>Some  who attended the meeting hoped for more specifics than Duke administrators  provided.</p>
<p>&quot;This  was a vast improvement over the last community meeting,&quot; said John Schelp,  a neighborhood representative who has been following the planning process.  &quot;But Duke's Central Campus plan is a collage of blank space and vague  footprints. We appreciate that they're meeting, but after three years of  asking, we expect more information than the vague answers we're getting.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>First phase of Central to  cost about $240M</strong> <br />
  (Duke Chronicle, 21 March 2006)</p>
<p>&quot;Everything  about Central is pie-in-the-sky, and yet they say something is going to happen  in 2008,&quot; the chair of chair of Theater Studies said. &quot;A lot of it  depends on how much money they can find. You can't just build a campus for  $39.95.&quot;</p>
<p>The  University-College zoning designation-which East and West Campuses already  have-limits any retail to businesses that are integral to the academic mission  of the University. It was seen by OWDNA as an essential protection for local  businesses from potential tax-exempt on-campus competition.</p>
<p>&quot;Peter Lange  has accomplished more [in terms of community relations] in two months than the  public relations office was able to do in two years,&quot; Schelp said.  &quot;But it's still the same set-up, where Duke talks for 45 minutes about  what they're going to do and when we ask questions the answers are always,  'We'll get back to you.'&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Duke</strong><strong> will discuss Central Campus</strong> <br />
  (Herald-Sun, 20 March 2006)</p>
<p>About  three weeks ago, officials in the Duke-Durham Partnership invited members of  the Old West Durham Neighborhood Association to the campus for an informal  meeting at which members of the neighborhood association could discuss any  town-gown issue, said the association's president, John Schelp.  The neighborhood members repeatedly said Central Campus was at the top of the  list, he said. </p>
<p>At  that meeting, Duke officials repeated an important assurance from last May --  that Duke will seek a college/university zoning for  the site that limits retail uses to those that serve its educational  mission.... &quot;Duke's announcement last year was a victory for common  sense,&quot; Schelp said Sunday. &quot;We look forward to seeing a development  plan for Central Campus.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Active Feet steps into new  place <br />
</strong>(News &amp;  Observer, 10 March 2006)&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Active  Feet has, at last, taken a walk. After 17 years on Ninth Street, the athletic-footwear  emporium is to be in its new shop, a block away, at 725 Iredell Street, this weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm  very excited,&quot; said owner Walter   Cleary, who began construction on  his new site last spring... With the move, Cleary's business grows from 2,600  square feet to 8,000 square feet designed expressly as &quot;a technical  running store.&quot; The new store allows for bigger circulation and better  customer service, he said. &quot;We can do a really wonderful job.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Column: A Safer Ninth Street</strong> <br />
  (Duke Chronicle, 16 February 2006)</p>
<p>One  of the joys of East Campus is its close proximity to Ninth Street. Last year, as a freshman, I  found almost whatever I needed just a short walk away. </p>
<p>Yet,  far more than mere convenience, the area also has unique people and an  intriguing culture surrounding its diverse group of shops. Although I frequently  poke fun at the left-wing nature of that culture -- the outrageous bumper  stickers and the slanted selection at the Regulator Bookshop -- it nonetheless  affected my life in a positive way last year by adding another dimension to my  college experience.</p>
<p>The  city of Durham  has not done enough to help rid Ninth    Street of its crime. There are some basic  improvements that could go a long way in preventing it and improving the area  in general. For starters, Perry    Street needs better lighting... In addition, both Durham and Duke Police  should patrol Perry Street  on a more regular basis.</p>
<p><strong>Column: Support structure  crumbling</strong> <br />
  (N&amp;O Durham News, 4 February 2006)</p>
<p>&quot;Don't  get me wrong, I love Durham,&quot;  Sima Flower, owner of PeaceFire Galleries said. &quot;It's time for us to  leave.&quot;</p>
<p>PeaceFire  was put to death for two reasons. Downtown construction has affected every  business in the Five Points area. Once upon a time Five Points was the place to  be. Flower and Willis were told the  area was on the move. Representatives from Downtown Durham Inc. encouraged them  to relocate from their former location on Broad Street.</p>
