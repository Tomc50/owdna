		<p><span class="style10 style11">&quot;One  of the major concerns to date has been whether a too-heavy commercial presence  of stores and restaurants on Central Campus would provide adverse competition  for nearby businesses on Ninth    Street. Businesses on Duke campus get an automatic  leg-up because of easy access for students and tax advantages not shared by  Durham-based entrepreneurs. It's important for all, as this process continues,  to make sure that Ninth Street -- one of Durham's most vibrant business areas  -- is enhanced, not hurt, by Duke's plans.&quot;</span><br />
	    --Herald-Sun editorial</p>
		<p><span class="style11">&quot;You've  got Duke putting everything they can on campus so the students don't leave and  things like that happening, which makes it that much harder for any business to  make it in any of these towns.&quot;</span><br />
	    -James Lee,  co-owner of &quot;305 South&quot; (N&amp;O, 8/13/06)</p>
		<p><span class="style11">&ldquo;It  makes abundant sense that the community should be interested in what happens in  the redevelopment of 128 acres of Duke's Central Campus.&rdquo;</span><br />
	    -Herald-Sun  editorial</p>
		<p><span class="style11">Thomas Stith said elected officials  &quot;need to be very cautious in giving Duke a blank check,&quot; and insist  that the university emulate other builders by giving the city a good idea of  how the project will be laid out.</span> <br />
	    -Herald-Sun</p>
		<p><span class="style11">&quot;I  like to think we are one of the premiere literary bookstores in the country.  This is going to be a huge store there, only a quarter-mile from us.&quot; </span><br />
	    -Tom Campbell,  The Regulator</p>
		<p><span class="style11">&quot;I  believe it's going to impact Ninth    Street business. If people have more choices, they  are going to have an impact.&quot; </span><br />
	    -Hamad Ghanayem,  nearby merchant </p>
		<p><span class="style11">&quot;I'd  like to see as much specificity as we can see on this, and that's something the  neighborhoods have asked for.&quot; </span><br />
	    -Councilman Mike Woodard </p>
		<p><span class="style11">&quot;In general, the more detail the better.  And I have a history of trying to work out stuff and trying to get as many  committed elements [in rezoning cases as possible.]&quot; </span><br />
	    -Councilwoman Diane Catotti</p>
		<p><span class="style11">&quot;Stith  singled out the question of commercial space, saying he wants restrictions that  make sure new enterprises don't have an unfair competitive advantage over  existing businesses.&quot;</span> <br />
	    -Herald-Sun</p>
		<p><span class="style11">&quot;If  anything we do stiffs Ninth Street,&quot;  executive vice president Tallman   Trask has said, &quot;then we'll  stop.&quot; Last week, Provost Peter   Lange repeated pledges that Duke has no intention of supplanting enterprises on Ninth Street&hellip;Yet, Lange acknowledged last week that Duke administrators have  talked about bringing a Barnes &amp; Noble bookstore to Central Campus, just a  quarter mile from The Regulator Bookshop on Ninth Street.&quot;</span> <br />
	    -Jennifer Hardison,  Old West Durham (letter in Herald-Sun)</p>
		<p><span class="style11">&quot;In  addition to the monetary advantages that a big public franchise like Barnes  &amp; Noble has over an independent bookstore like The Regulator, the fact that  a university-based Barnes &amp; Noble would be exempt from property taxes,  thereby giving it an additional financial advantage while relieving it of the  social responsibility of giving money back to the city from which it profits,  is criminal in principle, whether or not it is technically illegal.&nbsp;&quot;</span><br />
	    -Melissa Rooney,  Durham (letter  in Herald-Sun)</p>
		<p><span class="style11">&quot;Peter Lange  has accomplished more [in terms of community relations] in two months than the  public relations office was able to do in two years. But it's still the same  set-up, where Duke talks for 45 minutes about what they're going to do and when  we ask questions the answers are always, 'We'll get back to you.'&quot; </span><br />
	    -John Schelp,  Old West Durham</p>
		<p><span class="style11">&quot;[The  Barnes &amp; Noble] was a big concern to me. They were going to open a  bookstore a quarter of a mile from here.&quot;</span><br />
	    -Tom Campbell,  The Regulator</p>
		<p><span class="style11">&quot;Trask's  brazen attempts to exploit Duke's non-profit status to abuse Durham's retail market, without any consultation  with the faculty, continue to degrade Duke's standing as an institution that  exists for something other than its own promotion.&quot; </span><br />
	    -Michael Bacon,  Durham (letter  in Herald-Sun)</p>
		<p><span class="style11">&quot;I  wish there was a little more back and forth than the university letting us know  what they're doing.&quot; </span><br />
	    -Josh   Parker, Durham (Herald-Sun)</p>
		<p><span class="style11">&quot;Plans  to relocate the student bookstore and T-shirt shops to Central Campus caused  grave concerns among Durham  merchants and residents from near-campus neighborhoods. Too much commercial  development at Duke, they complained, could further isolate the walled-in  campus from the city and give students few reasons to go to nearby restaurants  or stores that count on their business.&quot; </span><br />
	    -News &amp; Observer</p>
		<p><span class="style11">&quot;Duke's  announcement last year [to go with limited retail zoning] was a victory for  common sense. We look forward to seeing a development plan for Central Campus.  We're just happy to help Duke become a better neighbor.&quot; &nbsp;</span><br />
	    -John Schelp,  Old West Durham</p>
		<p><span class="style11">&ldquo;These  meetings help sensitize us to these things.&quot; </span>-Provost   Peter Lange  (before Duke submitted a mostly blank Development  Plan)</p>
		<p><span class="style11">&quot;Plopping  down a big box Barnes &amp; Noble would be a disastrous expression of corporate  largesse and insouciance about the local economy. The Regulator is a  family-owned bookstore on 9th    Street with a college-feel, and could expand its  operation in a new facility on Central.&quot;</span><br />
	    -student column in Duke  Chronicle</p>
		<p><span class="style11">Director  of Dining Services Jim Wulforst explained that meal plan points are non-taxable  and thus can only be used on campus. </span><br />
	    -Duke Chronicle</p>
		<p><span class="style11">&quot;Duke gets these tax breaks because it's a &quot;non-profit,&quot;  but this looks a whole lot like &quot;for-profit&quot; behavior. I just don't  see other non-profits engaging in such elaborate schemes to avoid paying sales  tax. By opening up the DukeCard system to all local merchants, Duke  could avoid this appearance of impropriety, and Durham would receive the sales tax revenue.&quot; </span><br />
	    -Chris Sevick,  letter in Herald-Sun</p>
		<p><span class="style11">&quot;Duke,  which is considerably more well endowed than any of those institutions,  apparently gouges both their students and the local merchants while accepting  the two-fold subsidy we taxpayers give them as an educational institution: Tax  breaks for donors to the university and a pass on the payment of property and  sales taxes&hellip; Looks like they want it both ways: To be considered needy,  do-gooder education providers when it comes to claiming a public subsidy, while  playing aggressive, private sector-style entrepreneurs when it comes to  economic relations with the surrounding town.&quot;<br />
		</span>-Tom Clark,  letter in Herald-Sun</p>
		<p><span class="style11">&quot;My  assumption has been that it's a choice Duke has made  to keep all its transactions on campus.&quot; </span>&nbsp;-Tom Campbell,  Ninth Street  merchant</p>
		<p><span class="style11">&quot;[The  DukeCard] is almost the only thing you take out of your wallet all week...  People feel really comfortable in the Duke bubble and aren't as willing to get  off onto Ninth Street  as they should be.&rdquo; </span><br />
	    -Ian   Long, Duke  student (Herald-Sun)</p>
		<p><span class="style11">&quot;Whichever  way you cut it, somebody at Duke 'misinformed' me. I'm not interested  in affixing blame to either of these individuals, but I think it demonstrates  how frustrating it can be to deal with Duke's administration. It's time for  some straight answers. They have heard our concerns, and told us that they'd  get back to us with the details in a month. It's now been well over two months.&quot;</span><br />
	    --Chris Sevick, reply in Herald-Sun</p>
		<p><span class="style11">&quot;...it  is far worse to keep the surrounding business in Durham at their current disadvantage and to  continue to deny them business from Duke students.&quot;</span><br />
