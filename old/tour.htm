<p><font color="Green"><b><font color="Green"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><font size="5">Self-guided 
  Walking Tour Around East Campus</font></b></font></font></b></font></p>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Why is Ninth Street 
    called Ninth Street? What song writer for Norah Jones was 'born on a 
    kitchen table' near the East Campus wall? Where did Richard Nixon live 
    as a Duke Law student? What's the origin of Walltown? Where did Elvis 
    go to lose weight? Where did Madonna take early dance lessons? Take 
    this self-guided tour and find out.<br />
    <br />
</font>
	<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We'll begin at 
    the opening in the East Campus wall across from Whole Foods Market (Broad 
    &amp; Perry). Your route will follow the gravel path by the East Campus 
    wall (built in 1916) and offer forays into the surrounding neighborhoods. 
    The tour, including a stop on Ninth Street for a drink, will take less 
    than an hour.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Stop #1) Broad 
    &amp; Perry, break in East Campus wall: </b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Why does the stone 
    wall around East Campus stop for a stretch along Broad Street? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Before West Campus 
    was built in the late 1920s, the Duke (rather, Trinity College) football 
    team played their home games at Hanes Field -- named after the Winston-Salem 
    benefactor who made underwear. A red-brick wall with several ticket 
    windows facing Broad Street stood where the cedar trees now grow tall. 
    When the old wall started to tilt in the 1980s, it was torn down. The 
    field hockey team now plays here and Hanes Field has a new name -- Williams 
    Field. Back in 1913, the Durham Bulls played their very first game here 
    -- defeating the Raleigh Capitals, 7-4. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Across the street 
    is the neighborhood of Old West Durham, a turn-of-the-century mill village 
    that is a national historic district. Today, it is home to Ninth Street, 
    Magnolia Grill, Durham's oldest fire station, oldest pizza restaurant, 
    the Erwin Mills cemetery, and more than 80 different Duke operations. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Walk south along 
    the gravel path inside the wall.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><img src="graphics/tour/map.jpg" alt="1920s Map" width="480" height="437" /></font></p>
  <div id="caption">
    <div align="left">1920 Street Map: Trinity College is shown on the right while the Erwin Cotton 
      Mill is on the left (where the three railroad spurs extend north into 
      the mills). The West Durham mill village is north, west and south of 
      the mills. Walltown and Trinity Heights are north of the college while 
      Trinity Park lies to the east. Courtesy of Durham County Library.</div>
  </div>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Stop #2) Corner 
    of Broad &amp; West Main: </b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The large gray 
    houses across the street belonged to managers of the nearby cotton mills. 
    In the 1890s, living alongside the rail road tracks was considered desirable. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Beyond the gray 
    houses was the African American settlement of Brookstown. A hundred 
    years ago, a brick yard (owned by the Fitzgerald's -- one of Durham's 
    many successful African American families) made bricks for most of the 
    tobacco factories and textile mills. Today, the old brick yard is the 
    site of Duke's Freeman Center. Like Hayti and Hickstown, Brookstown 
    was torn apart when the Durham Freeway was built through the community 
    in the 1970s and 80s. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The hamlet of Pinhook 
    was located near the large pinkish gray Erwin Square tower to the west. 
    Established before 1850 (and before Durham existed), Pinhook was half-way 
    between the old colonial capital in Hillsborough and the new state capital 
    in Raleigh. The camp ground and tavern was a 'roaring old place' where 
    travelers could relax after a long day's walk.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Stop #3) Free-speech 
    tunnel and West Main Street: </b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">From 1887 to 1902, 
    street cars were pulled by mules along tracks on West Main Street (from 
    downtown to Erwin Mills). In 1903, the mules were replaced with electric 
    trolleys. A small loop was built around the southern end of the Ninth 
    Street shopping district and the trolley tracks were extended north 
    up Broad Street and west along Club Blvd. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 1905, President 
    Teddy Roosevelt's train stopped across from the East Campus entrance. 
    His arrival from Raleigh was announced in Durham by the sounds of factory 
    whistles in East Durham. Other industries and locomotives joined the 
    commotion with their whistles. It was all too loud for much of a speech 
    downtown. When he stopped here, Roosevelt extolled the college's recent 
    courageous stand for academic freedom (Bassett Affair) and remarked, 
    &quot;As I came in, gentlemen, I felt as if I was at a football contest.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Stop #4) Main 
    entrance and quad: </b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Look all the way 
    up the quad to Baldwin Auditorium. This area of East Campus roughly 
    follows the shape of the horse race track that was here before 1892, 
    on the grounds of the old Blackwell Fairgrounds. A horse raised here 
    named Baxter took third place in the Kentucky Derby.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">After Meredith 
    College declared it wouldn't locate in a &quot;rum-soaked mill village,&quot; 
    Durham business leaders set their sights on Trinity College. Julian 
    S. Carr and Washington Duke topped Raleigh's bid of Pullen Park and 
    $25,000 by offering these 62 acres and $85,000 for buildings and endowment 
    to bring Trinity College to the Bull City in 1892. (Good thing too, 
    Duke historians say the college would likely not have survived the Depression 
    of 1893 had it remained in Randolph County.) </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Across West Main 
    Street, just past the railroad tracks, is the Smith Warehouse. The largest 
    of the 12 warehouses operated by Liggett &amp; Myers Tobacco Co, it 
    will soon to be transformed into Duke class rooms and offices. Brightleaf 
    Square (old tobacco district) and downtown rise to the east.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Stop #5) The 
    Sower statue: </b></font></p>
  <p>Walk across the grass to the life-size iron statue of the man wearing
    a hat. Put a penny in the Johnny Appleseed statue and make a wish.
    If it's gone the next time you visit, your wish will come true. </p>
  <p>The original entrance road into East Campus ran straight past here
    (parallel to today's &quot;new&quot; entrance road).<br />

  </div>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Hidden behind the 
    large magnolia tree in the back is the Ann Roney fountain (ca. 1901). 
    This tribute is important because Ann Roney took care of Washington 
    Duke's two sons after their mother died. The Duke family went on to 
    become the university's major benefactor, building West Campus and changing 
    Trinity's name to Duke. [Today, this fountain has no plaque, no indication 
    of the role Ms. Roney played in Duke's history. Getting a plaque made 
    would be a wonderful project for a student group.] </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Stop #6) Corner 
    of Buchanan &amp; Minerva, Trinity Park: </b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Continue across 
    the grass to the first small break in the stone wall. Cross Buchanan 
    Blvd and walk up Minerva Ave into the neighborhood of Trinity Park. <br />
    The green 
      house at 1110 Minerva was built by &quot;Cap&quot; Card, the father of Duke basketball 
      who introduced the sport to the campus community in 1906.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Although many of 
    Trinity Park's early settlers were connected with Trinity College, the 
    majority were merchants, businessmen and professionals. In contrast 
    to Durham's late 19th-century neighborhoods, fewer Trinity Park residents 
    were directly associated with tobacco and textiles. They were part of 
    the broader local economy produced by their families' successes in Durham's 
    leading industries. These younger generations chose not to live in the 
    older neighborhoods where they grew up close to Durham's industries. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Local tradition 
    holds that Elvis Presley went through drug rehab at 310 Watts (large 
    red brick house with green roof -- just south of Minerva). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Turn left on Watts 
    Street and walk up to the playground. Some of the oldest houses here 
    were originally located on campus for Trinity professors and later moved 
    into the neighborhood.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Stop #7) Community 
    park: </b> </font></p>
  <p>In the 1970s, developers tried to build apartments on this corner.
    Neighbors mobilized, bought the land and built this corner park instead.
    Farther up the street is George Watts Montessori Magnet School -- the
    oldest brick school in Durham (ca. 1916). The school was originally
    named Watts Street School because George Watts (then School Board chair)
    objected to having it named after him. After he died, though, the name
    was changed to George Watts School. Gothic hints can be seen in the
    neoclassical motifs at the entrances and stepped parapets and buttressing
    on the facade. Turn left at Urban Street and walk back to East Campus.</p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Stop #8) The 
    Ark: </b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Near the break 
    in the wall is a three-story, white-frame building called the Ark (by 
    the East Campus coffee house). Built of salvaged wood from the grandstands 
    at the old race track, it's called the Ark because students had to walk 
    in pairs to make it up the narrow entranceway. One of the first college 
    basketball games in the state of North Carolina took place here in 1906 
    (where the sixth man was the iron columns in the middle of the court).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Following a &quot;humdinger&quot; 
    of a Southern Conference tournament in 1928, the Atlanta Journal wrote: 
    &quot;That Duke is going to be a big factor in conference is certain. They 
    have already done enough in basketball, whether they win the title or 
    not, to make their school remembered in Atlanta. In football, wrestling, 
    boxing, baseball and track, the baby member is going to make the old 
    timers look to their laurels. And we don't mean maybe.&quot; </font></p>
  <p>The American Dance Festival has brought many famous dancers to West 
    Durham for many summers. Perhaps the most famous person to ever sleep 
    on East Campus arrived in the summer of 1978. As a young ADF student, 
    Madonna honed her early dancing skills in the Ark (in Pearl Lang's &quot;Advanced 
    Modern Technique&quot; class) and took performance classes at Branson Theater. 
    Madonna also took a repertory class in Gilbert-Addoms and intermediate 
    ballet in the East Campus Union.</p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Stop #9) Markham 
    &amp; Onslow, Trinity Heights: </b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Following the path 
    around the bend, walk out through the break in the wall near the Baldwin 
    Auditorium sign. This area of campus still shows the old curves of the 
    horse race track where the ground slopes.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Cross Markham and 
    walk up Onslow Street (to the north). One of the first planned residential 
    developments in Durham, Trinity Heights has traditionally been home 
    for folks from a broad range of backgrounds and interests, including 
    employees and students of Trinity College.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This street is 
    a wonderful example of Duke's recent efforts to build quality in-fill 
    houses in an older neighborhood. Turn left onto Green Street.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Stop #10) Onslow 
    &amp; Green, Walltown: </b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Across Green Street 
    is the community of Walltown. In 1892, a young African-American man 
    named George Wall followed his job with Trinity College to Durham. Wall 
    bought a wooded plot of land north of what is now East Campus. Walltown 
    became a neighborhood for mostly African American workers moving into 
    the Bull City for jobs in the tobacco industry. The narrow shotgun houses 
    and small residences provided easy access to the tobacco factories. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Walltown's east-west 
    streets were lettered and its north-south streets were numbered. So, 
    you're now standing at what was once 3rd &amp; B streets. (Ninth Street 
    is called Ninth Street because of Walltown.)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The neighborhood 
    is crisscrossed with deep gullies and creeks. When this area of Durham 
    was first developed, wealthy interests purchased the highlands for larger 
    homes -- leaving bottomlands for smaller dwellings in gullies. If you 
    drive along the length of Englewood Avenue, for instance, you'll see 
    larger homes in elevated areas, smaller homes down in the stream valley 
    and bigger houses back at the top of the next hill. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Stop #11) Green 
    &amp; Berkeley:</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">For many years, 
    the block between Berkeley and Sedgefield was mostly open space. Duke 
    recently developed the land by building homes for university employees. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">When Trinity College 
    first began making plans to expand and become Duke University in the 
    1920s, administrators purchased this land and thought about extending 
    the original campus to the north. When word got out about Duke's plans, 
    real estate prices in Trinity Heights went through the roof. The idea 
    was dropped and school officials bought the Rigsbee farm to the southwest 
    instead. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Had the expansion 
    plans been kept secret, Duke Chapel and the quad might have been located 
    about where you're standing now. Instead, the Blue Devils now face football 
    foes where the Rigsbee family kept their pigs -- on what is now West 
    Campus. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Stop #12) Green 
    &amp; Clarendon: </b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Take a look down 
    Clarendon, towards East Campus. When he was a Duke law student, Richard 
    Nixon lived in the two-story blue house at 814. This house originally 
    stood a block farther south where the field hockey team plays on East 
    Campus.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><a name="JDLTour" id="JDLTour"></a></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Stop #13) Green 
    &amp; Iredell: </b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Hall of Fame song 
    writer John D. Loudermilk was 'born on a kitchen table' a block north 
    of here on Iredell. Loudermilk wrote some 1500 songs, including 'Tobacco 
    Road' (sung by Lou Rawls) and 'Turn Me On' (sung by nine-time Grammy 
    winner, Norah Jones).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the early days, 
    the entire area smelled like a Laundromat -- from the hot, soapy water 
    being discharged by the textile mills into what long-time neighbors 
    called the &quot;dye ditch&quot; (because it ran brightly colored when fabric, 
    usually denim, was being dyed). Today, the neighborhood is working with 
    the City and others to create a quiet urban greenspace along South Ellerbe 
    Creek, near the elementary school.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Stop #14) Green 
    &amp; Ninth:</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This is the heart 
    of Old West Durham. Long-time residents recall that a sawmill was placed 
    in the middle of the nearby woods to cut the planks to build the first 
    houses in the mill village. Company housing was modest with coal stoves 
    and running water. Most had electricity. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Several Italian 
    stonecutters who helped build Duke Chapel and the hospital lived in 
    this neighborhood. (Duke Hospital was built at the old &quot;Bone Yard&quot; where 
    Durham residents brought their dead cows and horses.)</font></p>
  <p>To the north is E.K. Powe Elementary (a Duke-Durham partnership school). 
    Up the hill is what Southern Living and Bon Appetit call one of the 
    best restaurants in the South -- Magnolia Grill. Just to confuse things, 
    a Mongolian grill is across the street in a new two-story red brick 
    building called Ninth Street North. This mix of retail and offices recently 
    replaced a block of vacant storefronts.  </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Several Duke student 
    groups have volunteered in Old West Durham -- doing everything from 
    picking up trash along creeks and railroad tracks to fixing up the elementary 
    school gardens and nearby Erwin Mills cemetery. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Turn left and head 
    up Ninth Street. Check out Durham's first Kentucky Fried Chicken at 
    806 9th Street. The owner asked Colonel Sanders if he could call his 
    franchise, &quot;Pete Rinaldi's Kentucky Fried Chicken.&quot; The Colonel agreed 
    -- making this restaurant one of a few KFCs in the nation to carry its 
    owner's name. During his visits to the Duke Rice Diet, the Colonel enjoyed 
    standing next to his life-sized fiberglass likeness (accurate down to 
    the eyeglasses and Rotary pin) at the KFC and startle the beejeezus 
    out of customers. Today, an artist's studio occupies the space.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Stop #15) Ninth 
    &amp; Markham, 9th Street shops: </b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Just to the west, 
    the Pizza Palace is Durham's oldest pizza restaurant. On the corner, 
    H&amp;K Printing used to be a bakery that elderly residents say, &quot;smelled 
    wonderful and made the best donuts in town&quot;. Generations ago, Charlie's 
    Sports Bar was Pender's grocery store -- famous for its wagon that delivered 
    goods to the mill village. Peek-a-Boo Bar &amp; Grill ('Famous since 
    2003') was the original Ninth Street Bakery.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Established in 
    1922, McDonald's Drug Store is the oldest business on Ninth St. Dogstar 
    Tattoo, was once West Durham Cash Store which sold dry goods. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Regulator Bookshop 
    was originally Cheek's Dry Cleaner's. Folks thought the glass blocks 
    were a bit fancy for a mill village shopping district. Books on Ninth 
    and the Blue Corn Cafe were once Rambeau's Barber Shop and nearby was 
    a pool hall -- Ninth Street's roughest spot. Most neighborhood kids 
    were not allowed to pass through its doors. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Stop #16) Erwin 
    Mills:</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The long red brick 
    building on the hill across the street seems to be an almost forgotten 
    footnote of history. And yet the Erwin Cotton Mills were the driving 
    force that made Old West Durham what it is today. Started by the Duke 
    family the same year Trinity College came to Durham (1892), the new 
    company bought several adjacent tracts of land and built the mills, 
    picker building, dyehouse, boiler room, and engine house. The steady 
    noise of the mills reverberated throughout the surrounding village. 
    The humming roar so pervaded the workers' consciousness that they noticed 
    it only when it ceased, making Sundays seem unnaturally still. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Past the old mill 
    building, the neighborhood spoke in favor of the development of high-density 
    apartments to help support the shops and restaurants here. Local lore 
    holds that Elvis Presley also lived incognito in a caboose on a railroad 
    spur near Jim's Party Store (Hillsborough Road &amp; Trent) while he 
    was on the Rice Diet in the late 1960s.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Stop #17) Lower 
    Ninth Street:</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Vaguely Reminiscent 
    once served as both Kime Barber Shop and the West Durham Beauty Shop. 
    Art Craft Framing was Morgan's Cafe for many years. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">On the night of 
    Martin Luther King's assassination, the front of Morgan's Cafe was hit 
    with a lit gasoline-filled bottle and Couch's Furniture Store was burned 
    to the ground (replaced with the brick building you see today). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Native Threads 
    once housed the popular Ruby's Cafe. Campus Florist was Brewer's Drug 
    Store for many years. Brueggers Bagels is in the old Fidelity Bank. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">A couple of two-story 
    mill houses stood across Ninth St from the old bank (where Specs is 
    now located). Don Schlitz grew up in one of these houses and went on 
    to compose, &quot;The Gambler&quot; -- the song made famous by Kenny Rogers that 
    was eventually made into a movie. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Stop #18) Ninth 
    &amp; Perry: </b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the 1920s, Ninth 
    Street was part of Old NC 10 --the first roadway that crossed the state 
    (going from the Atlantic coast to the Tennessee border).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Beyond the BP on 
    West Main St, you can see a rusty bridge over Ninth. This is the site 
    of the future Ninth Street commuter rail station that will connect this 
    old mill village with RTP and Raleigh. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Turn left onto 
    Perry Street. Once called Hillsboro Ave, Perry connects Ninth Street 
    with East Campus (just ahead). Durham's only bike shop is here as well 
    as one of the nine churches that was started in the mill village.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Congratulations, 
    you're done. Hopefully, this tour will give folks a better sense of 
    place for the neighborhoods beyond the walls and may help open more 
    connections between Duke and the surrounding community. Come back for 
    another visit, you're always welcome!</font></p>
