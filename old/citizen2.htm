        <p>Below is some background on the statute which provides information 
          on how to identify a nuisance property.</p>
        <p>This language could help identify properties in your neighborhood that 
          would be candidates for the abatement process. </p>
        <p>   To begin the Nuisance Abatement process, contact City Attorney, Patrick Baker at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:patrick.baker@durhamnc.gov">patrick.baker@durhamnc.gov</a>&nbsp;or 560-4158. </p>
        <p> <b>Civil Nuisance Abatement Actions </b></p>
        <p>Introduction: North Carolina's nuisance abatement statutes, codified 
          at G.S. Sections 19-1 et seq., were first enacted into law in 1913. 
          However, for over eighty years, the statutes received sporadic use because 
          abatement actions could only be brought by the Attorney General, district 
          attorneys, or private citizens. An amendment to G.S. Section 19-2.1, 
          which became effective on December 1, 1995, now permits cities and counties 
          to initiate civil nuisance abatement actions in the name of the State 
          of North Carolina. Thus, local governments are no longer dependent upon 
          the initiative of either the Attorney General or district attorneys 
          to bring abatement actions. </p>
        <p> <b>Identifying Nuisance Property</b></p>
        <p>* The property focused upon may be either commercial or residential. 
        </p>
        <p>* Not all criminal activity can be used to support a civil nuisance 
          abatement action. The State will need evidence of the following types 
          of activity: </p>
        <p>-Prostitution <br>
          -Gambling <br>
          -Illegal possession or sale of alcoholic beverages <br>
          -Illegal possession or sale of controlled substances<br>
          and/or <br>
          -Breaches of the peace such as homicide, assault, possession of dangerous 
          or deadly weapons, discharging firearms, etc. </p>
        <p>* Due to the language of the statutes, the types of activities listed 
          above must have occurred repeatedly. While one time clearly is not enough, 
          there is no "magic number." The number of occurrences needed to support 
          a nuisance action will depend on the totality of the circumstances including, 
          but not limited to, the nature of the calls (obviously a homicide would 
          be given greater weight than a gambling offense) and the dispositions 
          of the calls (a call for service which results in an arrest may be given 
          greater weight than a call which is unfounded). </p>
        <p>* The offenses referred to above must have occurred on the property 
          or be directly connected to the property as in the case of a fight that 
          started on the property and then spilled over onto the sidewalk or street. 
        </p>
        <p> <b>Who May Bring An Action For Abatement </b></p>
        <p>* Attorney General</p>
        <p>* District attorney</p>
        <p>* County or municipality upon approval of the County Commissioners 
          or City Council</p>
        <p>* Private citizen upon the posting of a $1000. bond </p>
        <p> <b>Nuisance Investigation, Procedure and Litigation </b></p>
        <p>A civil nuisance abatement action is not a "quick fix." The investigation, 
          preparation and disposition of a civil nuisance abatement action can 
          be very time-consuming; involving months of work. </p>
        <p> <b>Assistance From the Public </b></p>
        <p>* Call the police if you witness or suspect criminal activity. Oftentimes 
          we find that people are reluctant to report certain crimes because they 
          believe that the police will not be able to cite or arrest the suspect. 
          For instance, a person may witness someone urinate on his or her lawn, 
          but not call the police because the suspect will most likely be gone 
          by the time the police are contacted and can arrive on the scene. While 
          a citation or arrest may not result, contacting the police is very important 
          because it creates a record for future evidentiary purposes. </p>
        <p>* Notify your community liaison officer of property which you have 
          identified as a potential nuisance under General Statutes Sections 19-1 
          et seq. </p>
        <p>* Provide an affidavit for the State if requested to do so and be willing 
          to testify at trial. </p>
        <p>* If a nuisance action is pursued and a judgment is entered against 
          the defendant, notify your community liaison officer of any activity 
          that you believe may be a violation of the judgment. If the defendant 
          violates a court order, he may be held in contempt of court. </p>
        <p> <b>Conclusion </b></p>
        <p>If the State can establish a nuisance by a preponderance of the evidence, 
          the court: </p>
        <p>* must enter an order permanently enjoining the defendant and any other 
          person from further maintaining the nuisance at the place complained 
          of and elsewhere within the State </p>
        <p>* must order that any lewd matter, illegal alcoholic beverages, gambling 
          paraphernalia, and illegal controlled substances be destroyed and not 
          sold; </p>
        <p>* may require, with few exceptions, the effectual closing of the place 
          against its use thereafter for the purpose of conducting any such nuisance 
        </p>
        <p>* may void the lease or other title held by a tenant or occupant </p>
        <p>* must tax the costs of the action against the defendant. </p>
        <p>However, if the defendant prevails, the costs of the action, including 
          reasonable attorney&acute;s fees, will be taxed against the State. In 
          addition, a lost case may create unfavorable case law for future litigation. 
        </p>
        <p>Therefore, the initiation and pursuit of a civil nuisance abatement 
          action should not be entered into lightly. It is usually an action reserved 
          for situations in which traditional law enforcement methods and other 
          administrative remedies (such as zoning, health and fire inspections) 
          have failed. </p>
