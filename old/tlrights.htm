        <P>Landlords and tenants are free to bargain about many terms of rental 
          agreements, and apartments or mobile homes should feel free to seek 
          changes in terms or conditions which they feel are not in their best 
          interest before signing any rental agreement.</P>
        <P>Once the bargaining is over and both landlord and tenant have agreed 
          to a set of conditions or terms, both parties are required to carry 
          out these terms and conditions. </P>
        <P>However, the landlord and the tenant have duties and rights established 
          by law, and while the law provides great leeway for both landlords and 
          tenants to bargain about terms, the law does not permit either to surrender 
          certain rights or fail to carry out certain duties established by law.</P>
        <P>(Note: This pamphlet refers to residential leases. The law is different 
          for commercial leases. See an attorney for more information.)</P>

        <P>Your Rights As A Tenant</P>
        </B><FONT SIZE=2><FONT COLOR=black> 
        <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As long as you fulfill your legal duties and the requirements 
          of your rental agreement, you have the right to exclusive possession 
          of property you rent or lease for the term of the rental agreement. 
          However, even as you exercise your basic right to privacy, your landlord 
          may retain in the lease a right to inspect your dwelling at reasonable 
          times and in a reasonable manner.</P>
        <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
        <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If your landlord does not live up to his duties as 
          set by law and the terms of the rental agreement, you have the right 
          to:</P>
        <OL>
          <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(1)&#9;complain to him, 
          <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(2)&#9;complain to appropriate government agencies, 
            such as your local building and health departments, 
          <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(3)&#9;exercise your rights under law or the rental 
            agreement which you have signed,</P>
          <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(4)&#9; join with other tenants to secure your rights. 
            These rights may be exercised without fear of eviction.</P>
          <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
          <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, if after reasonable notice, your landlord 
            fails to carry out his legal duties, you have the right to move out 
            of the dwelling you are renting, thereby ending your rental agreement. 
            Moreover, you have the right to seek relief in court if the landlord 
            fails to fulfill his duties. If you seek relief in court and the court 
            decides in your favor, it may reduce the amount of rent you must pay 
            until the landlord fulfills his duties, and/or award you money damages.</P>
          <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
          <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tenants may not withhold rent payments in order to 
            force the landlord to fulfill his duties without the permission of 
            the court.</P>
          <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
          <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If your rental agreement was prepared by your landlord, 
            the law provides that in the event of a dispute between you and the 
            landlord, any unclear terms or conditions should be interpreted in 
            your favor.</P>

              to repair damage caused by you or your guests. However, you are 
              not responsible for ordinary wear and tear or damage caused by nature 
              or people you do not permit to come into your home.</LI>

            them in good, clean condition. If you holdover at the end of the term 
            and the landlord continues to accept rental payments from you, unless 
            your rental agreement otherwise provides, the law may deem you to 
            have entered a new term of lease according to the same terms as your 
            rental agreement. For example, if you have a lease agreement for a 
            one-year term and holdover at the end of the term you may be bound 
            to an additional one-year term.</P>
          <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
          <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To protect yourself you should make a thorough inspection 
            of the premises you intend to rent and set out in writing any damages 
            or defects in the premises existing when you take occupancy, so that 
            you will not be held responsible for them at the end of the term.</P>
          <P>If something goes wrong with your home which is the landlord&#146;s 
            duty to fix, you should let him know in writing what needs to be repaired 
            and you must give him a reasonable amount of time to get the repairs 
            done. What amount of time is reasonable depends on the nature of the 
            problem. Leaks, a broken furnace in winter, and bad wiring etc., should 
            be corrected promptly. It may be reasonable, however, for a landlord 
            to take a few weeks to repair other problems.</P>
          <P>If the problem is a real emergency, your notice to not have to be 
            written, but it is always wise to give a dated written notice and 
            keep a copy for yourself.</P>
          <P>REMEMBER: The landlord's obligation to perform his duties is dependent 
            on your performance of your duties as a tenant.</P>

          <P><B>Your Rights As A Landlord</b></P>
          <FONT SIZE=2><FONT COLOR=black> 
          <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you are a landlord, you can rent your property 
            for whatever amount you choose, although you may not raise rent during 
            the term of a lease and you must give proper notice to your tenant 
            of any change if there is a periodic tenancy (week-to-week or month-to-month). 
            You may rent to whomever you wish and you may set any terms in your 
            rental agreement you wish, provided that they are not contrary to 
            local, state or federal laws. You do not have the right to relieve 
            yourself of duties imposed on landlords by the law. While generally 
            you may refuse to rent to anyone, you may not discriminate against 
            a tenant or prospective tenant because of his race, color, religion, 
            ancestry, sex, country of birth, handicap, or familial status. The 
            prohibition against discrimination based on familial status makes 
            it illegal, in most circumstances, to refuse to allow children to 
            live in a residential unit. </P>
          <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
          <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You may evict a tenant, who violates any provision 
            of your rental agreement, which you and the tenant have agreed is 
            a ground for eviction. Failure to pay rent is always a ground for 
            eviction.</P>
          <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
          <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You may reserve the right to enter, inspect, and 
            make repairs on or show the rental property at reasonable times and 
            in a reasonable manner.</P>
          <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
          <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You have the right to have your property returned 
            to you in the same condition as it was when the tenant took possession, 
            with the exception of ordinary wear and tear and damage done by natural 
            forces or people other than the tenant or his guests.</P>
          <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
          <P><B>Your Duties As A Landlord</b></P>
          <P>As a landlord you have a duty:</P>
          <P>(1) &#9;To comply with current applicable building and housing codes;</P>
          <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(2)&#9;Make all repairs and do whatever is necessary 
            to put and keep the rental premises in a fit and habitable condition;</P>
          <P>(3)&#9;Keep all common areas in safe condition;</P>
          <P>(4)&#9;Maintain in good, safe working order, and</P>
          <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">promptly repair all electrical, plumbing, sanitary, 
            heating, ventilating, air conditioning, and other facilities and appliances 
            which you have supplied or are required by your agreement or any law 
            to supply after you have been notified by the tenant of any defects 
            in writing (in emergencies such notice does not have to be in writing).</P>
          <P>(5)&#9;To provide and install battery-operated or electrical smoke 
            detectors and to place new batteries in a battery-operated smoke detector 
            at the beginning of the lease.</P>
          <P>You must perform any other duties required by your rental agreement.</P>
          <P>You may also be required to allow a tenant with a disability to modify 
            the premises and accommodate that tenant's needs.</P>
          <P>Except in emergencies, you must notify your tenants in writing of 
            any breaches by the tenant of duties imposed on him by law.</P>
          <P>Security Deposits</P>
          <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A landlord is permitted by law to charge his tenants, 
            as a security deposit, up to two weeks' rent if the tenancy is week-to-week, 
            up to one and a half month's rent if the tenancy is month-to-month, 
            and up to two months' rent for tenancies of longer periods. If you 
            wish to keep pets on the premises, the landlord may charge you a reasonable, 
            nonrefundable fee as a pet deposit in addition to the security deposit. 
          </P>
          <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
          <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If a tenant breaks a lease, the landlord may use 
            the security deposit to protect himself from loss if (1) a tenant 
            fails to pay rent, (2) damages the rental property, or (3) leaves 
            before the end of the rental term or without proper notice, (4) if 
            the landlord has court costs evicting the tenant or other costs of 
            re-renting the rental property or (5) if a lien is created on the 
            rental property because of the tenant's use.</P>
          <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
          <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A landlord who receives a security deposit from a 
            residential tenant must either deposit the money in a bank or savings 
            and loan trust account or obtain a bond from a licensed insurance 
            company to secure repayment of the security deposit to any tenant 
            who is entitled to its return. The landlord must tell the tenant within 
            30 days after the beginning of the lease the name and address of the 
            savings institution holding the account or the insurance company providing 
            the bond.</P>
          <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
          <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Within 30 days after the end of any lease the landlord 
            must either refund the security deposit to the tenant or deliver an 
            itemized statement of any damage or injury together with any balance 
            of the security deposit. If the landlord does not know the tenant's 
            address he must hold the balance of any security deposit for at least 
            six months. Landlords are not required by law to pay interest on security 
            deposits to the tenant. Landlords may not withhold any part of the 
            security deposit for conditions due to normal wear and tear. The landlord 
            may keep the deposit only to the extent necessary to cover his losses.</P>
          <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
          <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If a landlord sells the rental property, he must, 
            within 30 days thereafter, either return the deposit balance in the 
            manner set out above or transfer it to the new owner and notify the 
            tenant of this fact.</P>
          <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
          <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tenants may sue landlords for accountings, the return 
            of security deposits or for actual damages if the landlord fails to 
            comply with his duties concerning such deposits. If a landlord is 
            found by a court to have willfully failed to comply with the law concerning 
            security deposits, the court has authority to require the landlord 
            to pay the tenant a reasonable attorney's fee.</P>
          <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
          <P>Late Fees</P>
          <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A landlord may impose, pursuant to a rental agreement, 
            a late charge on any rental payment five days or more late, of the 
            greater of $15 or 5 percent of the rental payment, but no more. A 
            late fee may be imposed only one time for each late rental payment 
            and may not be deducted from a subsequent rental payment so as to 
            cause the subsequent rental payment to be in default.</P>
          <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
          <P>Who Owns What</P>
          <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tenants should be aware that unless they have an 
            agreement with their landlord saying otherwise, any improvement the 
            tenant makes to the rental property may become a part of the real 
            estate, thus belonging to the landlord at the end of the rental term. 
            Tenants should be aware of this before they install or affix anything 
            to the real estate such as carpeting, bathroom fixtures, light fixtures, 
            shutters, shrubs, etc.</P>
          <P>Eviction</P>
          <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In North Carolina a landlord may evict tenants by 
            a special court procedure called summary ejectment if the lease is 
            breached or terminated. A landlord in North Carolina may not use self 
            help such as cutting off utilities or locking tenants out of their 
            homes in lieu of summary ejectment. The Clerk of Superior Court in 
            your county has the forms and information you need to bring a summary 
            ejectment action in magistrate's court.</P>
          <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
          <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, accelerated evictions may occur for 
            tenants and all members of the tenant's household if criminal activity 
            (such as drug trafficking) has occurred."</P>
