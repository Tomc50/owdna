      <p>FOSEC and Durham Stormwater Services coordinated this creek clean-up 
        at East End Park where more than twenty volunteers gathered in the rain 
        to clear more than 2.5 tons of litter from Goose Creek. Our clean-up was 
        featured in water bills mailed to all Bull City households. (Photos courtesy 
        of Durham Stormwater Services)</p>

      <p>Volunteers check out old oil furnace. Two Duke students were pulling 
        out a rusty transmission when an elderly resident came out to see the 
        goings on. She told us she was born in her house by this creek, looked 
        around, and immediately pulled on some work gloves to lend a hand. </p>

      <p>Volunteers cleared log jams blocking two culverts, filled several bags 
        of debris and hauled out two bicycles, three car seats, a soccer goal, 
        shopping cart, drenched mattress, and an old oil furnace. FOSEC has organized 
        more than 40 clean-ups along the two creeks we've adopted with the state 
        (one through Durham Central Park and Trinity Park and the other through 
        Old West Durham and Walltown).</p>

        Vital in Removing Water Pollution<br>
        </font></b> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">(Reuters, 
        April 5, 2001)</font></font> <br>

        <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Streams play a bigger 
        role than previously thought in removing pollutants before they get to 
        larger waterways, scrubbing as much as half of the excess nitrogen from 
        fertilizer runoff and auto emissions, scientists said on Thursday.</font> 
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A nationwide study 
        of 12 streams found that the smaller the stream -- with its shallow depth 
        and high surface-to-volume ratio -- the more quickly nitrogen was removed, 
        scientists said in the latest edition of the journal Science.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Previously, experts 
        studying pollution focused on larger bodies of water rather than small 
        streams, considering them more like gutters that simply carried nitrogen 
        to lakes, rivers and oceans.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Excess nitrogen can 
        cause ecologically damaging effects in large waterways, including algal 
        blooms, which can kill fish and other aquatic animals.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Bruce Peterson of 
        the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, one of 
        the study's 15 co-authors, said the finding could have important implications 
        for land-use policies. He said human efforts to control streams by covering 
        or channeling them have made them less effective at nitrogen removal.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Streams remove nitrogen 
        by providing a habitat for nitrogen-absorbing organisms and by releasing 
        nitrogen from the water into the atmosphere.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Small tributary 
        streams in our watersheds, the ones most likely to be plowed under or 
        buried in culverts or destroyed by human activity, have a very important 
        role to play in removing nitrogen from water," Peterson said.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"If we restored and 
        took care of all the small streams on the landscape, our water quality 
        coming down rivers would be greatly improved," he said.</font> </p>

      <p><font color="#000000">"In 50 years, Durham had spread rapidly from a 
        village to a bustling factory center, sucking in the rolling pine country 
        around it. Shacks for factory workers mushroomed in the lowlands between 
        the graded streets. The little communities, which clung precariously to 
        the banks of streams or sat crazily on washed out gullies and were held 
        together by cowpaths or rutted wagon tracks, were called the Bottoms. 
        It was as if the town had swallowed more than it could hold and had regurgitated, 
        for the Bottoms was an odorous conglomeration of trash piles, garbage 
        dumps, cow stalls, pigpens and crowded humanity ...." </font></p>
