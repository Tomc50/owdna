<P><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Letter to City 
  Council, County Commissioners and Planning Dept:</b></font>
<p>Thanks for your 7/10/02 letter seeking input on changing the Future Land Use 
  Map from the existing use of Office to Low-Density Residential (case A02-09). 
</p>
<p>With its 303D status, the Ellerbe Creek watershed is listed as Durham's most 
  polluted stream system. Protecting Ellerbe Creek near I-85/Cole Mill Road would 
  reflect the City Council's priority to "protect natural areas." </p>
<p>Urban creeks are the most neglected and degraded creeks in the nation -- polluted, 
  channelized, littered, and forgotten. Yet, these streams contribute to urban 
  drinking water, and also provide recreation and refuge from concrete and asphalt. 
</p>
<p>The Friends of South Ellerbe Creek strongly support changing the use from Office 
  to Low-Density Residential.</p>
<p>thank you,</p>
<p>John Schelp <br>

  to the editor, Herald-Sun. December 15, 2000)</font></font> 
<P><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">South Ellerbe 
  Creek flows for three miles through some of Durham's oldest and most densely 
  developed neighborhoods (Old West Durham, Walltown, Trinity Park and Northgate 
  Park). </font> 
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It is home to 
  wild rose and blackberry bushes, wild pear trees, cat tails, thrush grasses 
  and other wetland plants, large bullfrogs, rabbits, racoon and several varieties 
  of birds -- including red tail hawks and great blue herons. </font> 
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">After crossing 
  under Northgate Mall's massive surface parking lots and Interstate 85, South 
  Ellerbe flows into what was a greenbelt of forests and farms that separated 
  Durham from Braggtown. It was here, on Thanksgiving Day, that an old 18" terra-cotta 
  pipe burst, spilling 4.5 million gallons of raw sewage into the creek for a 
  period nine days -- the biggest sewage spill in the state.</font>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Once detected, 
  the City of Durham responded to the spill quickly and capably. However, the 
  City of Durham must take responsibility for the slow detection of this spill 
  of raw sewage into South Ellerbe Creek and the Neuse River system. The City 
  uses automatic monitoring devices in the wastewater pipes to detect spills. 
  But the one person in charge of monitoring the computer readings was out sick, 
  so the spill went unnoticed. Durham must give a higher priority to protecting 
  our public trust waters by giving more attention to this very important duty. 
  The first step could be training existing employees as back up operators and 
  making the readings public so that more people could monitor for leaks. The 
  City is permitted to discharge treated water into the creek. For this privilege, 
  it must show respect for the community and the natural environment and take 
  responsibility for protecting the creek from such disasters. </font> 
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We also ask that 
  the risk of spills be minimized by placing a priority on prevention. Inspecting 
  wastewater pipes with more frequency, and replacing the old terra cotta pipes 
  that are likely to crack over time with more durable piping, should be at the 
  top of the list. The spill on South Ellerbe Creek could have been prevented 
  by a system to detect and replace high risk pipes. Durham should be commended 
  for having already mapped its wastewater system, and should be able to use these 
  maps to locate pipes that are compromised such as the pipe on South Ellerbe 
  Creek. </font> 
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Urban creeks are 
  the most neglected and degraded creeks in the nation -- polluted, channelized, 
  littered, and forgotten. Yet, these streams contribute to drinking water for 
  urban communities, and also provide recreation and refuge from concrete and 
  asphalt. Restored rivers help make cities livable again, offer many urban residents 
  a significant connection to nature, and provide enormous benefits for public 
  health, recreation, economic growth, and community pride. </font> 
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The Friends of 
  South Ellerbe Creek and the Neuse River Foundation ask the City of Durham to 
  take appropriate measures to protect our waterways by investing the necessary 
  resources to prevent such disasters in the future. </font>
