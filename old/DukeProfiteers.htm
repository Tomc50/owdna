          -Tom Clark</strong></p>
        <p> Duke University official John Burness spends most of his February 
          17 column describing, presumably accurately, Duke's good citizenship 
          with respect to the environment and the local economy in managing Duke 
          Forest. He explains in particular, the history of Duke's record with 
          regard to the 'piece of the puzzle' land in Orange County that is so 
          controversial these days. This is welcome information, as far as self-congratulations 
          go. However, the last few words of his column go like this:</p>
        <p>&quot;[Duke]... also [has] a fiduciary responsibility to generate revenue 
          from those limited portions of the Forest that are not essential and 
          important to the mission of the university, [emphasis added] so that 
          revenue so generated can support our academic mission.&quot;</p>
        <p>I suppose we can thank Mr. Burness for his brutal honesty. But this 
          declaration is alarming to those of us who feel the effects when this 
          800-pound gorilla flails about. If you presume that Duke's leadership 
          has the same attitude about the entire Duke enterprise as Mr. Burness 
          has articulated here about the Forest, the quote amounts to a declaration 
          that they are open for business, that they will use all assets they 
          own, not merely the fundraising they do based on their performance and 
          good reputation as a school, as investments to be made to further pile 
          up money. This is the worst-case scenario to those of us concerned with 
          the University's ongoing threat to use tax-advantaged dollars, received 
          on the basis of a non-profit educational mission, to compete with local 
          private enterprise (see the Central Campus retail controversy).</p>
        <p>We give tax-exempt status to educational institutions precisely to 
          support their academic mission, and to ease financial pressure so that 
          they can focus on that mission, since an educated citizenry is in everyone's 
          interest. So why should we allow these advantaged dollars, that come 
          at the expense of a community full of increasing needs and increasingly 
          desperate for revenue sources, to be used to compete with local business? 
          What about a fiduciary responsibility for citizens to see that all members 
          of a community contribute their fair share to society's overhead? I'm 
          afraid the answer to those questions could be that Duke has better lawyers, 
          a public relations team (read: spin doctors) and enough sheer influence 
          to get away with it -- the might-makes-right, 800-pound gorilla scenario.</p>
        <p>How will this policy play out in other issues? As the largest employer 
          in the county, Duke has a chance to set the progressive pace on paying 
          a living wage for example. But with the &quot;Burness doctrine&quot; 
          as articulated above, the quality of life of Duke's frontline work force 
          would simply lose out to any number of other projects, since paying 
          people more that you absolutely have to doesn't directly and demonstrably 
          contribute to any bottom line numbers. So instead we are likely to have 
          Duke leading the race to the bottom on that issue, literally putting 
          the community further into poverty.</p>
        <p>For better and for worse, the fiduciary responsibility of soul-less 
          corporations that exist in perpetuity to turn a profit, is, we all must 
          admit, the economic engine that drives American life. While this is 
          ultimately a problem for the entire society, indeed, the entire world, 
          it's a particular shame to have such thinking invade the area of education, 
          where the rules seemed to be relatively clear. </p>
        <p>One would hope that the educational mission of Duke would include teaching 
          by example. Are Duke officials teaching their students to grab all they 
          can get and only give back when there's a quantifiable monetary advantage 
          to doing so? Or do they acknowledge that sharing the collectively made 
          good fortune is the only way to sustained collective prosperity?</p>
        <p>The question really is: Who's running the show over there, the educators 
          or the bean-counters?</p>
