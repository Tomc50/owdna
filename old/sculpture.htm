        <p></p>
        <p>Fending off drizzle with umbrellas and raincoats Saturday, dozens of 
          people cheered as two streamlined metal birds were unveiled. </p>
        <p>The sculpture, "Seconds Before Flight," is surrounded by flowers and 
          stands on a small, grassy plot on the corner of Ninth Street and Hillsborough 
          Road to designate the Old West Durham neighborhood. </p>
        <p>Each sculpture consists of a long arch that outlines the bird's body, 
          leading to a golden head with the wings tucked behind the body. </p>
        <p>"The idea [for the sculpture] is that at any time we can change our 
          lives," Karl Pfister said. "That people can do what they want at any 
          time." </p>
        <p><img src="graphics/ninth/a019_19.jpg" width="454" height="305"></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="Navy">OWDNA

          (by Kelly Rimer).</font><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          </font></p>
        <p>Pfister came up with the idea for the sculpture several months ago 
          and approached the Old West Durham Neighborhood Association. </p>
        <p>"This area didn't really have an identity as a neighborhood," Pfister 
          said. "I wanted to do something that would look nice in the space. I 
          was thinking it'd be a great place to have something like this here 
          for a long time."<font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          </font></p>
        <p>Pfister, who works as an artist and blacksmith for Cricket Forge and 
          Vega Metals, worked on the sculpture after hours in his spare time and 
          completed it in about a month. His boss, Frank Vega, donated the steel 
          for the sculpture, and his co-workers helped him with sandblasting and 
          painting, Pfister said. </p>

        <p></p>
        <p>Pfister said the birds were designed so that passing motorists could 
          take them in visually in a few moments. </p>
        <p>Pfister donated the sculpture to the association in Saturday's commemoration 
          ceremony. It was placed beside a sign reading "Old West Durham: Diversity, 
          Harmony, Community." </p>

        <p> </p>
        <p>"A hundred years ago, this corner was very different," said John Schelp, 
          president of the association. "We had the humming of the Erwin Cotton 
          Mills right across the street." </p>
        <p>Schelp outlined the area's history and landmarks, including the textile 
          mills and a cemetery. </p>
        <p>"We are very proud of this corner and this neck of the woods," Schelp 
          said. </p>
        <p>Congressman David Price then congratulated the group on its efforts. 
        </p>
        <p>Pfister thanked the crowd for its support and expressed his love for 
          the neighborhood in which he and his wife have lived since 1996. Pfister 
          is married to Gaye Weaver, and their son, Eli Pfister, is the fifth 
          generation of their family to live in Old West Durham. </p>
        <p>Weaver's grandfather lived with his parents and five siblings on Edith 
          Street. </p>
        <p>"I want to say that I love this neighborhood," Pfister said. "This 
          place just means so much to me and my wife and my child. It means a 
          lot to me that we can call a place like this home." </p>
        <p>Pfister has also created other sculptures around the Triangle and recently 
          completed the iris fountain for the Doris Duke Center. </p>
        <p>"I've done my job as an artist if this place is just a little bit nicer 
          because of my sculptures," Pfister said. "And I feel like I've done 
          my job." </p>

            <font size="2">Herald-Sun (2 April 2004)</font></font></p>
        <p>As a sculptor, Karl Pfister creates warmth and beauty from cold, hard
          steel.</p>
        <p>Dark, curly hair framed his face as he gazed though wire-rimmed glasses
          at his creation of forged steel and zinc, coated with epoxy paint and
          accented with brass wrappings. Pfister poured more than two months
          of his free time into this modern art with its swirls and curls, metal
          kissing metal, symbolizing a man and a woman embracing.</p>
        <p>&quot;When I originally did the piece, the whole idea was of a male
          and a female,&quot; he said. &quot;When other people started looking
          at it, they said, 'That's not what it looks like at all. It looks like
          a woman.' And I could see that. I decided people could interpret it
          any way they wanted.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Significant Other,&quot; his work in Durham Central Park, was
          commissioned by The Grace Fund in remembrance of Grace Richardson,
          a Durham resident who was killed by a drunken driver. The sculpture
          will be dedicated at 10 a.m. Saturday.</p>
        <p>The Grace Garden is tucked away on a rugged strip of ground near the
          Durham Farmers' Market. A serpentine, herringbone brick path runs past
          a sculpture by Andrew Preiss and toward the hillside where Pfister's
          9-foot work is dwarfed by a pair of huge white oaks.</p>
        <p>The artist also helped create 23 incredibly realistic flowers for
          Duke Gardens and has his own sculpture on the grassy traffic island
          at the intersection of Ninth Street and Markham Avenue, a pair of stylistic
          steel swans with copper tails entitled &quot;Seconds Before Flight.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;I really like copper,&quot; said Pfister, who also works in
          bronze and steel, heated by coal or gas and stretched and bent with
          special tools. &quot;It's always beautiful. It even smells good when
          you work it, when it's warm.&quot;</p>
        <p>But there is special significance to &quot;Significant Other,&quot; his
          offering in Durham Central Park.</p>
        <p>&quot;I'm really just happy to be a part of this,&quot; he said. &quot;For
          years I've walked around this whole area of town and felt like it was
          my little personal fiefdom, because there weren't many people around
          here.</p>
        <p>&quot;But over the past few years, with the Central Park going on,
          it just makes me happy to be a part of this. It's a small part, because
          it's obviously not the biggest sculpture in the world, but there are
          a lot of artists in this area and it's neat to be a part of this.&quot;</p>
        <p>Pfister, who inherited a creative nature from his father Robert, a
          commercial designer, works for Francis Vega and Neal Carlton at Vega
          Metals, and its sister business, Cricket Forge, located on Hunt Street
          just around the corner from Durham Central Park.</p>
        <p>It was in the midst of a haircut when Pfister's barber told him about
          Vega Metals, created by two construction welders almost two decades
          ago.</p>
        <p>&quot;He showed up one day and said, 'I want to work for free,' &quot; said
          Vega, who surprisingly enough was not surprised at the statement.</p>
        <p>&quot;People think, for some reason, that artist blacksmith work is
          romantic, or something of that nature,&quot; he explained. &quot;We
          have a lot of people coming by to try and volunteer.&quot;</p>
        <p>When Vega decided to give Pfister -- who studied journalism and law
          in college -- a chance, he had no great expectations.</p>
        <p>During a break from learning to weld aluminum, Pfister was asked to
          explain how he ended up a metalworker. He couldn't help but laugh.</p>
        <p>&quot;I didn't really want to be a journalist,&quot; he said. &quot;I
          wanted to be a musician, but it didn't work out. I did want to do something
          creative, and law school wasn't going to cut it.&quot;</p>
        <p>It did not take long for Pfister to realize ordinary people would
          not last more than a couple of months in this job.</p>
        <p>&quot;When I first came to the shop, I couldn't do anything,&quot; Pfister
          said. &quot;I've learned everything from welding to hammering to forging.
          It takes a good five years to learn to be a metalworker.</p>
        <p>&quot;It's a hard job,&quot; he said. &quot;The thing about it is
          it does allow you -- if you're willing to put in the time -- to be
          creative.&quot;</p>
        <p>Seven years later, it is obvious there is nothing ordinary about Pfister.</p>
        <p>&quot;He has keys to our facility and you'll find him here evenings
          and weekends, learning and creating art on his own,&quot; said Vega. &quot;He's
          had some shows of his own and created some wonderful pieces. I was
          pretty amazed at his piece over on Ninth Street.&quot; <br>
