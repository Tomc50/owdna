          <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">I visited with Joe
          Johnson a couple of blocks from the abandoned textile mill that was the town of
          Erwin's lifeblood. For nearly a century, Erwin Mills made denim cloth, and the
          town proudly called itself "the denim capital of the world." Joe worked in the
          mill from 1943 until his retirement in 1986.</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The closing of Erwin
          Mills last year signaled the passing of an age, and not just in Erwin and
          Harnett County. Textiles remains the state's largest manufacturing industry,
          but textile employment has declined by almost half in the last 30 years.
          Boarded-up textile mills and empty cotton warehouses are an enduring part of
          our landscape now.</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Joe and I talked at a
          wonderful museum that he and other Erwin Mills veterans have launched next to
          the public library downtown. The museum highlights Erwin's mill village
          heritage. And this past year, despite the mill's closing, Erwin still
          celebrated "Denim Days," its largest festival. Joe says the Chamber of Commerce
          hasn't decided yet whether to rename the festival in the future, but no matter
          what, you're all welcome.</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><img src=
          "../graphics/millvill2/Vchatter3.jpg" width="384" height="349" alt="Carriages at Ervin Mills"	          /><br /><font color="navy">Mr. F.L. Fuller and Mr. B.N. Duke (first carriage) and Mr.
          W.A. Erwin and Mr. J.S. Cobb (second carriage) visit Erwin Mill No.
          2.</font></font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">My father was raised
          here on the Cape Fear River, and that was long before they even imagined the
          mill starting here. When the Dukes and the Erwins and all those folks decided
          that they wanted the property, my family literally sold them the farm. My
          family -- the Johnsons and the Averys and the Snipes -- sold the land to the
          folks that wanted to build the mill, helped build the mill, and then went to
          work in the mill and stayed there till they died.</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">My father, my uncles and
          aunts, you name it, they were all there. They did everything from spinning the
          cotton to making the cloth. One of the first houses that was built was a
          boardinghouse for the mill officials, and my grandmother ran it. They ran a
          drop cord from the mill to Granny's, and that was the first house that had
          electricity.</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">My mother, her family
          lived up beyond Lillington and came down to Erwin, got a house and got jobs in
          the mill. Lots of times, you'd have folks who, back in the early days, worked
          on the farm all their life. That farming life was tough. They'd have a family
          in town that they knew, and they'd come in and live with them because the
          person in town here had a steady job, where the guy on the farm did not. He was
          a sharecropper.</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Cotton was hand-picked
          in the fall of the year. Then the farmer would take it to the gin and you'd see
          a line of trucks and mules and wagons here to the mill. Cotton was weighed and
          sold right here, and they'd end up weaving it and selling it. We made more
          denim cloth than any place in the world. At one time, our capacity was a
          million linear yards, or more, a week, and that's a fact. We could lay it on
          you.</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Erwin plant always
          made primarily denim. When I was a child, denim meant overalls, pure old bib
          overalls, like the old country boy out planting his farm with his mule would
          wear. And coveralls, say, for a mechanic. Later, we got into making some
          lightweight denim too, like that shirt you're wearing. We were proud of our
          product.</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">During the Depression,
          this plant never stopped. It never stopped. It ran. There are some shrewd
          people that have operated Erwin Mills. The Duke family and their friends were
          all millionaires, and they came down here to the east bank of the Cape Fear
          River and bought land.</font></p>

          Erwin, NC (Mill No. 2): Fourteen men with prominent positions in the Durham
          community: (front, left-right) BN Duke, Washington Duke, JB Duke, TJ Walker, AB
          Carrington, JS Cobb, John Angier; (back) Dr. AG Carr, WA Erwin, JE Stagg, Frank
          Tate (in charge of building Erwin Mill No. 2), ES Yarbrough, Capt. Lemon (in
          charge of building Durham &amp; Southern railroad) and FL Fuller (photo taken
          in 1904).</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">They bought land in the
          1890s and the mill was up and running by 1903. They built a big mill and a
          power plant and a brick mill. They built the churches, a hospital, houses for
          folks. They owned the railroad, too. We had our own icehouse, our own cotton
          gin, blacksmith shop. And in town, everybody had a garden. I mean a big garden.
          Out on the edge of town, the mill owned all the land and if you wanted a bigger
          garden, you could have your bigger place down just 4 or 5 blocks away. A lot of
          folks would raise hogs and the hog pens were all on the edge of town
          too.</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Folks came from all over
          the country trying to get into the little town of Duke. That's what Erwin was
          called at that time. Then, in 1925, the Dukes and the Erwins built an entire
          new mill, doubled the number of houses, and brought in the doctors and
          merchants that you need. There were families that were working in Erwin Mills
          in Durham, and the entire families moved down here. There was a big population
          of Durham folks here.</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">They didn't just work in
          the mill. The mill provided us with a swimming pool, tennis courts, a bowling
          alley, even started a theater. We had a semipro ball team. We had a town band.
          We had a zoo, and we had a big park. After the guys worked in the mill, they
          would come home, get all dolled up, then they'd sit out in the park. Maybe
          you'd bring your girlfriend. Back when I was a child, we'd go out there and sit
          on the park bench and there would be silent movies.</font></p>

          Erwin Park (Erwin, NC)</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">I'll never forget that
          mill whistle either. You had your "wake whistle." That was an hour or more
          before you started work, then when the "work whistle" sounded everything
          started humming. Most of the time, folks got used to it and never even heard
          it. It was just part of the scenery.</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">All that went its way
          after the Second World War. That was a whole new world of change then. In the
          late '40s and early '50s, the houses were sold to the employees, and they
          started selling off the different farmlands and whatnot. Most of the folks
          bought the houses. I bought mine.</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The mill finally closed
          because they could make more money operating in Mexico than in Erwin, North
          Carolina. Bottom line. At the peak time, the mill probably employed around
          2,400 folks. But later on, in the late '70s, when the new machinery began to
          come in, it dwindled down to about 1,400 in about a 10-year period. Attrition
          took care of most of them.</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">But when they closed the
          mill down for good, you're talking about 1,400 people losing their job in a
          two-year period. The first folks were the young bunch, the recent hires and
          some with maybe 10, 12 years seniority. But the last bunch, there was a group
          that was within 2 to 5 years of retirement. That's the ones that took a
          licking. They were offered to go back to school and learn this new trade, but
          when you got a 55- or 60-year old guy, he's not too interested in going back to
          a computer lab or something.</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">I'd be the same way. I
          never saw a computer till I was about 45. My son works at BTI, my
          daughter-in-law works for IBM, and I go in their computer room at home and I
          see all that stuff, and I say, "Hey, that's nice. That's great. Let's go to
          Home Depot!"</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">For a memorable day
          trip, motor down Route 55 and discover the Erwin History Room at 100 West F
          Street (next to Erwin Town Hall). If you like old mill villages, this trip
          comes highly recommended. What a wonderful collection of Erwin Mills artifacts
          and old photos -- including several items from the mills in Old West
          Durham.</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The electric hair weave
          machine is a must-see. You'll also enjoy old photos and B&amp;W footage of
          Erwin Mills, Erwin Park, Erwin swimming pool, and Erwin School.</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Afterwards, grab
          something to drink at Shirley's Diner (in the business district next to the
          mills). This two-story, red-brick building on the corner was the original
          company store. Then drive around Erwin Mills No. 2 and the surrounding mill
          village. It'll all look very, very familiar!</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Erwin History Room
          is open to the public on Sunday and Wednesday (2:00-4:00 pm). Free admission.
          While you're there, say hello to museum docents, Joe Johnson and Vic Fowler.
          Both worked many years at the mills in Erwin and both have kin in Durham (Joe's
          relatives lived in the mill village near Erwin Road and Vic has kin on Gin and
          on Carolina).</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Directions from Old West
          Durham: Follow Route 55/East to Erwin. In a hurry, take I-40/East to I-95/South
          to Dunn (exit 73). Take Route 421/North to Erwin. The mills, town hall, and
          Erwin Mills History Room are west of the highway. On your way down or back,
          stop for a real meal at "Ma's Kitchen" -- on Route 55 in Coats, NC.</font></p>
