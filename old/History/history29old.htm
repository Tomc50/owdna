		  <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">From Allibay and 
            Watery Branch to Pinhook and Allergy Creek, the history of Ellerbe and 
            South Ellerbe creeks is long and colorful. During his 1701 trek through 
            the wilderness of the Carolinas, John Lawson headed east from Occaneechi 
            Town (near what is now Hillsborough). Lawson wrote of hiking 14 difficult 
        miles, &quot;a sad stoney way,&quot; to the next village, called Adshusheer.</font></p>
		  <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">One local theory 
		    holds that Ellerbe Creek might have been &quot;the pretty rivulet&quot; that Lawson 
		    crossed -- just south of the Duke family's homestead in Durham County.</font></p>
		  <p><img src="../graphics/history/b024.jpg" alt="b024" width="501" height="298" /></p>
		  <div id="caption">Duke homestead and early tobacco factories --the modest beginning of tobacco empire. Washington Duke, man with hoe, walks on his farm (ca. 1890).</font></div>
		  <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the earliest 
		    grants and on the earliest maps, Ellerbe Creek was spelled </font><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&quot;Allibay.&quot; 
		      That spelling led a few scholars to theorize that Ellerbe might be of 
		      Native American derivation. When the Europeans arrived, the North Carolina 
		      Piedmont was dominated by Sioux-speakers such as the Eno, Occaneechi, 
		      Saponi, Sissipahaw, Tutelo, and Shoccoree.</font></p>
		  <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Different European 
		    ears heard the Siouxan consonant that had a sound somewhere between 
		    an R and an L. Thus, there is much speculation about Ellerbe Creek's 
		    oldest name. In the days before standardized orthography, the creek 
		    carried a variety of names including, Allibay, Allibay's, Eleby, Ellerbee, 
		    Ellerbie, and Ellerbe (we use the state's spelling).</font></p>
		  <p><font size="2">According to the The Colonial Records of North Carolina 
		    (1886-90), John Ellerby (Allaby), who received land grants in what is 
		    now Anson County, may have first taken up land in present Durham. Historian 
		    Jean Anderson opines that Ellerbe Creek took it's name from that family.</font></p>
		  <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 1737, surveyors 
		    traveled up from New Bern looking for &quot;the Enoe fork.&quot; The last creek 
		    the surveyors found on the west side of the Neuse (before the Eno River) 
		    was &quot;Deep Creek.&quot; Today, that stream is called Ellerbe Creek. </font></p>
		  <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Before 1752, when 
		    this territory was still part of Granville county, some landgrants referred 
		    to Ellerbe Creek as &quot;South Eno.&quot; In the late 18th century, South Ellerbe 
		    Creek was called &quot;Watery Branch.&quot;</font></p>
		  <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><img src="../graphics/ellerbee/watershed2.jpg" alt="Watershed 2" width="360" height="231" /></font></p>
		  <div id="caption">Patches of flowers in wooded area behind Costco indicate earlier dwellings may once have stood here.</font></div>
		  <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The oldest landgrants 
		    in this area were from the agents of Lord Granville. Almost all of the 
		    several hundred Granville grants in old Orange county were on bottom 
		    land along the major creeks and rivers (including less than a dozen 
		    Granville grants on Ellerbe Creek). </font></p>
		  <p><img src="../graphics/JohnCollet1770.jpg" alt="John Collet" width="480" height="235" /></p>
		  <div id="caption">1770 map showing Allabay's Creek (Ellerbe 
		    today) in the middle. You can even see the two tributaries of South 
		    Ellerbe -- one flowing through present-day Old West Durham and Walltown 
		    and the other flowing north past what is now Durham Central Park, Trinity 
		    Park, Old North Durham and Duke Park. The point where the Eno River 
		    and Allabay meet is now under the waters of Falls Lake, in eastern Durham 
		    County. (source: Collet's Map of North Carolina, ca. 1770.)</div>
		  <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the early days, 
		    settlers avoided the inferior land in the Triassic Basin and gravitated 
		    to the richer alluvium of the Haw valley and the upper Eno valley.</font></p>
		  <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Ellerbe Creek-Goose 
		    Creek in the Upper-Neuse basin and the New Hope Creek-Mud Creek-Sand 
		    Creek- Third Fork Creek in the Cape Fear basin drain most of the Durham 
		    portion of a 200-million-year-old sea bed.</font></p>
		  <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Bennett Place, 
		    site of the Civil War's largest troop surrender, is crossed by Ellerbe 
		    feeders. James Bennitt's original deed mentions that his land was on 
		    &quot;waters of New Hope Creek and Ellerbe Creek,&quot; meaning it was on both 
		    sides of the ridge that divides the Neuse and Cape Fear watersheds.</font></p>
		  <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><img src="../graphics/history/a005.jpg" alt="a005" width="517" height="368" /></font></p>
		  <div id="caption">Surrender 
		    of Confederate General Johnston to General Sherman at the Bennitt family 
		    farm in 1865.</font></div>
		  <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="NaVY"></font><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Today, 
		    the North Carolina Railroad crosses Durham following this ridge. To 
		    the north of the tracks, all tributaries including Ellerbe creek and 
		    its feeders flow past Raleigh, Smithfield, Goldsboro, Kinston, and New 
		    Bern into Pamlico Sound. South of the tracks, the tributaries empty 
		    into New Hope Creek -- eventually flowing into the Atlantic below Southport. </font></p>
		  <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The paths of South 
		    Ellerbe and Ellerbe follow the history of Durham itself. Several grist 
		    mills and saw mills along its banks have disappeared from the records. 
		    South Ellerbe was more Blue collar in its origins while Ellerbe held 
		    more middle class origins. All these creeks flow through some of the 
		    Bull City's most historic urban neighborhoods.</font></p>
		  <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Old West Durham 
		    was built for workers in the textile mills, Walltown for workers in 
		    the tobacco industry, Watts-Hillandale for shop owners and doctors and, 
		    Trinity Park for merchants and teachers at a new college which would 
		    eventually changed its name to Duke University. </font></p>
		  <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">A number of springs 
		    feed a number of little creeks that become South Ellerbe and Ellerbe 
		    creeks. Ellerbe Creek begins its course west of Cole Mill Road and crosses 
		    Hillandale Golf Course and the neighborhood of Watts-Hospital-Hillandale. 
		    When Watts Hospital was moved to Broad Street from Trinity Park, many 
		    doctors and merchants built their homes along West Club Boulevard (beginning 
		    around 1908). </font></p>

		  <div id="caption">Confluence of South Ellerbe and Ellerbe, in Northgate Park neighborhood.</font></div>
		  <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Ellerbe then flows 
		    through areas that were forests and farms until the 1950s. Duke Homestead 
		    was one of those farms and is now surrounded by housing developments 
		    in what was a large green belt separating Durham and Bragtown. </font></p>
		  <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">South Ellerbe&acute;s 
		    headwaters rise next to what was once the settlement of Pinhook, which 
		    served as a traveler's rest on the dirt road between the colonial capital 
		    of Hillsborough and and the new state capital of Raleigh. </font></p>
		  <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 1906, W.S Lockhart 
		    wrote that Pinhook was, &quot;known as a place of brawls and rough-and-tumble 
		    fights, drinking, gambling and other forms of amusement, where the natives 
		    and visitors met to have a rough, roaring, and to them, glorious time.&quot;</font></p>
		  <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Beginning near 
		    Greystone Baptist on Hillsborough Road, South Ellerbe Creek flows for 
		    three miles through some of Durham's oldest and most densely developed 
		    neighborhoods. </font></p>
		  <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Today, the first 
		    mile of the creek is surrounded by various auto and muffler shops, large 
		    surface parking lots, a plumbing shop, funeral home, photo studio, small 
		    apartment complex, the Southern Railroad, Highway 70/Business, a Duke 
		    warehouse, an old gas station, and a number of quiet back yards. Its 
		    path will take it past three schools: EK Powe Elementary, Brogden Middle 
		    and Club Boulevard Elementary. </font></p>
		  <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 1892, the Rigsbee 
		    family sold a northern stretch of its farm to make room for the Erwin 
		    Mills and some of the surrounding mill village near Ninth Street. Also 
		    in 1892, Trinity College moved next door -- to Blackwell's Fairgrounds 
		    (eventually becoming Duke's East Campus).</font></p>
		  <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">25 years later, 
		    the rest of the Rigsbee farm was sold and became Duke's West Campus. 
		    Duke's football stadium was built in the ravine where the Rigsbee's 
		    kept their pigs (site of the 1942 Rose Bowl, moved to Durham after Pearl 
		    Harbor). Many of the Italian stonecutters who built Duke Chapel and 
		    the hospital lived in West Durham, near South Ellerbe. </font></p>

		  <p> </p>
		  <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Crossing the northern 
		    edge of the old Erwin Cotton Mills, South Ellerbe Creek was channelized 
		    and used to dump warm dyes from the mills. At the dawn of the new millennium, 
		    many of the mill families still in Old West Durham simply call it the 
		    &quot;ditch.&quot;</font></p>
		  <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Long-time residents 
		    of the mill village recall that a sawmill was placed in the middle of 
		    the woods to cut the planks to build the first mill houses -- along 
		    the creek. In the early days, the entire neighborhood smelled like a 
		    Laundromat -- from the hot, soapy water being discharged by the <a name="JDLEllerbee"></a>textile 
		    mills into South Ellerbe. </font></p>
		  <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Hall of Fame and 
		    Grammy-award winning composer John D. Loudermilk (who wrote 'Tobacco 
		    Road') grew up on the banks of South Ellerbe. During the Prohibition, 
		    a house on Virgie Street was one of the most popular destinations in 
		    all of West Durham. In the back yard were two doors. One was prominent 
		    and led nowhere. A second was small and mostly hidden. Visitors would 
		    pass through the smaller door to enter a large room filled with floor-to-ceiling 
		    cabinets -- each with a small padlock. Inside the private cabinets was 
		    a collection of favorite spirits. </font></p>
		  <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">According to long-time 
		    residents, White Lightning was the brew of choice. Consumption only 
		    allowed off-site. One resident recalls a scandalous morning in the 1930s 
		    when a body was found in South Ellerbe Creek across the street. Scared 
		    the neighborhood kids half to death. Turns out he was fine -- just an 
		    avid consumer of local moonshine. Today, this area forms the heart of 
		    the National Registry Historic District in Old West Durham and the proposed 
		    site for an urban green space.</font></p>
		  <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the late 1880s, 
		    a young African-American man named George Wall followed his job with 
		    Trinity College to Durham. Wall bought a wooded plot of land just north 
		    of what is now East Campus. Walltown became a neighborhood for workers 
		    moving into the Bull City for the growing tobacco industry. The narrow 
		    shotgun houses and small residences provided easy access to the tobacco 
		    factories. The east-west streets were numbered and the north-south streets 
		    were lettered (which explains why Ninth Street is called Ninth Street). </font></p>

		  <div id="caption">Earth 
		    Day creek clean-up in Walltown Park.</font></div>
		  <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">From Walltown, 
		    South Ellerbe Creek flows under Guess Road, the massive surface parking 
		    lots at Northgate Mall, and Interstate 85. According to the Durham Architectural 
		    and Historic Inventory, rapid growth during the 1950s, transformed the 
		    forests and farmlands into neighborhoods like Northgate Park. </font></p>
		  <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Another branch 
		    of South Ellerbe flows north from downtown through Old North Durham 
		    and Trinity Park --joining its sister streams near West Club Blvd Elementary. 
		    After emerging from the downtown tobacco warehouse district, the creek 
		    passes the old Pearl Cotton Mills site. Cottages from the mill village 
		    can still be see where South Ellerbe crosses under Trinity Avenue.</font></p>

		  <div id="caption">Pearl Cotton Mills in 1900 (Erwin Mill No. 6)</div>
		  <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Although many of 
		    Trinity Park's early settlers were connected with Trinity College, the 
		    majority were merchants, businessmen and professionals. In contrast 
		    to Durham's late 19th-century neighborhoods, a smaller proportion of 
		    Old North Durham and Trinity Park's residents were directly associated 
		    with tobacco and textiles. They were part of the broader local economy 
		    produced by their families' successes in Durham's leading industries. 
		    These younger generations chose not to live in the older neighborhoods 
		    where they grew up close to Durham's industries. </font></p>
		  <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Standing along 
		    this branch of South Ellerbe are the Durham Athletic Park (South Ellerbe 
		    flows under the pitcher's mound), Durham Central Park (bisected by the 
		    creek), Pearl Mills, and the South Ellerbe bike trail (which will eventually 
		    become part of the &quot;urban Appalachian Trail&quot; &#150; a bike path connecting 
		    towns from Maine to Florida).</font></p>
		  <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The three branches 
		    join forces near Northgate Park and flow east, past the Avondale Road 
		    K-Mart, Camden Avenue asphalt plant and the old City dump. Near the 
		    dump, Ellerbe Creek was channelized, chocked with industrial effluent 
		    and leachate (which one writer has called &quot;garbage juice&quot;). At the turn 
		    of the last century, the local wags were already calling it &quot;Allergy 
		    Creek&quot; (from Ernest Seaman's novel, &quot;American Gold&quot;).</font></p>
		  <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Ellerbe&acute;s 
		    last miles are its most serene as it flows along a quiet stretch of 
		    bent trees and into Falls Lake at an old wooden railroad bridge (less 
		    than a mile south of where the Eno River flows into the lake).</font></p>

		  <div id="caption">Allibay Creek approaches Falls Lake</font></div>
		  <font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Along some wooded 
		    stretches, Ellerbe's creeks quietly flow through areas as scenic as 
		    any in North Carolina. Elsewhere, the Ellerbe watershed deserves its 
		    status among state&acute;s most polluted creeks. Flowing past history 
		    and through Durham's neighborhoods, these 'pretty rivulets' absorb the 
		    city's ills as their waters journey toward the sea. </font>

                50 years, Durham had spread rapidly from a village to a bustling

                Shacks for factory workers mushroomed in the lowlands between 
                the graded streets. The little communities, which clung precariously 
                to the banks of streams or sat crazily on washed out gullies and 
                were held together by cowpaths or rutted wagon tracks, were called 
                the Bottoms. It was as if the town had swallowed more than it 
                could hold and had regurgitated, for the Bottoms was an odorous 
                conglomeration of trash piles, garbage dumps, cow stalls, pigpens

                  city is built on a low ridge which serves as a watershed between 
                  the Eno and the Neuse on the north, and New Hope creek, which 
                  is a tributary of the Cape Fear, on the south. As might be expected 
                  the soil is poor and unsuited to the cultivation of most crops 
                  that a pioneer would be likely to raise. So a student is likely 
                  to conclude that in the early settlement of the country this section 
                  would not be taken up by the first settlers. The more fertile 
                  tracts along the New Hope on the south and the Eno and Neuse on 
                  the west and north attracted the new home-seekers and the land 
                  lying between them was for some time left vacant. Later on, when 
                  the settlements became more thickly populated, the shiftless were 
                  pushed out of the fertile acres and came into this poor section 
                  of country and built themselves homes. As all know, the shiftless 
                  and poor are liable to give way to the less refined forms of vice 
                  and we find the people of this section no exception to the rule.&quot;</font></p>
