        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> I can&#8217;t
            explain how this community came to be. It certainly was strong and
            breathed on its own. It was ever changing, as life seems to be and
            yet stayed the same. The entire area that I grew up in from 1952 &#8211; 1970
            was truly a family community. The mill village of West Durham, NC
            was glued together by the cotton mill. I have heard stories from
            the 1920&acute;s and 30&acute;s that were passed down from my parents
            and grandparents. This was a time of commitment, from the family
        and the company. </font></p>

          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> The company committed
            to take care of her employees by providing them with basically everything
            they needed in order to work in her mill. The families all lived
            within walking distance of the mill, in houses that were subsidized
            by the mill. This was due to the fact that many people could not
            afford a car. Even so, the mill village had its own little social
            hierarchy. The title you held in the mill decided the location, size
            and type of house you were given the opportunity to rent. I learned
            about this form of society at the young age of 13. Before, I travel
        down that road, let me start with my earliest childhood memories. </font></p>

           author, Holly Marlow Hall, in front of her grandmother's house at
          710 
          Bolton Street. Next door was Buchanan's, a local store mainly for people
           working at Erwin Mills (1954).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">My Grandmother, (my mother&#8217;s mother) was Ruth
            Malone Clayton. Nanny to me. She worked in the spinning room at the
            mill. I am not
          sure what she did but when she would come home and take off her shoes,
          there would be small pieces of half moon shaped metal pieces she called
          travelers, stuck in the soles of her tennis shoes. I would sit at her
          feet and pull these metal pieces out for her as she would tell us about
          her day in the mill. Her hair would be full of cotton lint and look
          as if she had been out in the snow. She was always very tired. Within
          a block of her house was a little neighborhood store us kids would
          walk to in the afternoon. It was in the fork of Alabama Ave and Knox
          St. If we looked very pitiful and sad the owner, Mr. Marrow would give
          us free ice cream. At a very early age, most of us could have won an
          academy award from all of the &#8220;acting sad&#8221;. Always look
          down at the floor and frown when he told you that you didn&#8217;t
        have enough money - it worked every time. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="../images/PhotosMems/frankloomfixer1953sm.jpg" width="196" height="256"></font></p>
        <p><font size="2">A few blocks over from Nanny&#8217;s were my father&#8217;s
            parents, Frank and Nola Marlow - . Mammy and Pa to me and my brother,
            Barry.
          Frank worked in the mill. They lived on 13th Street (Bolton St. today).
          I have more memories of this area since Nola was the one I stayed with
          during the day when my mom and dad went to work in the mill. <br>
          <br>
          Frank was a loom fixer, a mechanic by today&#8217;s standards. As a
          young couple, more job opportunities lured Frank and Nola Marlow to
          move from Selma/Smithfield area of N.C. to the big city of Durham.
          Farming was no longer profitable. <br>
          <br>
          During my preschool years, both my parents were working the second
          shift. The hours were from 2:30 PM until 10:30 PM. During this time,
          I stayed at the Marlow&#8217;s on 13th Street. Pa Marlow worked 1st
          shift. He went to work each morning around 6:00 AM and worked until
          2:30 PM. I can still see his grey thermos and lunch box he would take
          with him every day as he walked down to the end of the street to the
          big Grey gate. <br>
          <br>
          Pa&acute;s backyard was fenced in on three sides. This was not his
          choice. This property backed up to the mill fence. Sometimes if Pa
          forgot his lunch, he would either walk to the big Grey gate and I would
          take it to him, or he would come to the back fence and I would run
          to the end of the back yard the throw him a sack over the fence. I
          would always run to the gate when I would see the &quot;lights flash&quot;.
          Mill employees were very well disciplined plus the noise was so great
          inside the mill, hearing was next to impossible. Therefore, the lights
          would flash to indicate it was time to eat, take a break or the shift
          had ended. I would wait, like a little faithful puppy, for Pa to come
          through the gate. The fun was waiting to see him come around the building.
          It was the same thing every day, but it never, never stopped being
          exciting and fun. <br>
          <br>
          Everyday was like seeing him for the very first time. Overalls were
          the uniform of the day to work on the looms in the mill. I don&#8217;t
          know if the mill brought them or not. Not being tall enough to reach
          his corner right top pocket, I could always see the corner of something
          sticking out. Every day without fail there was some type of candy or
          gum in that pocket. Everyday he would scoop me up in his arms and carry
          me the rest of the way home. I was always barefooted in the summer
          and the rocks hurt my feet. Maybe it the anticipation of wanting to
          see him that sent me back to the fence day after day but somehow I
          think it was just that good OLE grandpa love.<br> 
          <br>
          The sense of family. This was another component in the glue that held
          the mill people together. Families lived together and stayed together.
          Not always because they wanted to, but because they had to. It was
          survival. Somehow we not only lived through it but we were stronger
          people because of it. <br>
          In the early 1960&acute;s a new bleachery was built directly behind
          my grandparent&#8217;s house. I remember how dusty and dirty it was
          during the construction. My grandmother, Nola, fussed about the mess
          for the longest time. Each Monday was her wash day. She hung their
          wet clothes outside on a clothes line. Many days, they would have to
          be re-washed. <br>
          <br>
          The mill management decided it was too expensive to cut the mill all
          summer long. One day 15-20 head of sheep appeared on the other side
          of the fence. Their job was to eat the grass. That made my entire summer.
          Every afternoon after supper, I went to the fence to feed the sheep.
          They were luckiest and fattest sheet on earth. These sheep dined on
          Mammy&#8217;s home-made from scratch biscuits almost every day. The
          sheep could tell supper time. If I were late, they would come to the
          fence and bleat.</font><br>

            And that she did. I remember her telling me when they first moved
            into
            the four-room
          house on 13th Street, rent was $6 a week. She was wondering how they
          would be able to pay rent when Frank only made $12 a week. The house
          was always immaculate. You could eat off the floors, they were so clean. <br>
          <br>
          However, things were not good in the beginning. I remember being told
          that before they remodeled, the house sat on cinder blocks with no
          under-pinning, and the cracks were so wide in the floors that when
          she swept the floor, she would sweep the dirt thru the cracks in the
          floor. Winters must have been very cold. Everyone heated with coal
        (the furnace came with the remodeling). </font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">The remodeling
             came when the mill decided it was not financial beneficial for them
            
          to own these houses. They gave the employees the opportunity to buy
             them. I believe this was after the Burlington Industries bought
            the 
          old Erwin Cotton Mills. I can only speak to the "remodeled" house.
          It  had four rooms. A large kitchen, large living room, a large bedroom
          
          and small bathroom and a tiny back porch. The bedroom and living room
           had hardwood floors. The rest was tile. </font></p>

          Mammy always made her curtains. Of course, Mammy made everything. She
             sewed all of her clothes, mine, and a lot of my mothers. In later
            years 
          I learned to appreciate having all of the clothes hand-tailored made. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Nola brought all
             of her fabric or material as she called it for making her "frocks" from
              Ms. Pearl Dean on Ninth Street. The Remnant Shop was the name of
             the 
          9th Street Store. But to our family it was simply known as "Pearl Dean&acute;s." 
          Part of the East-West Express way was name after her husband, "Buck" 
          Dean. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Sometimes I would
             spend Saturday night with Mammy and Pa. That was the most fun. I
            can't 
          explain how clean and fresh the boaster pillow smelled (today we call
             them body pillows, but they have been around a long, long time). </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">I remember in
            the  summer time laying in the bedroom, with the lights from the
            bleachery 
          lighting up the room like day time. The wooden back door, wide open.
             The screen door, most of the time, would not even have the latch
            locked. 
          There was a gentle humming from the mill. That was her way of singing
             her children to sleep at night, a lullaby for a hard week&acute;s
             work.  The next day would be Sunday. For most all mill people, that
             meant church. 
          For us it was Greystone Baptist Church. With a young Malbert Smith.
              My grandparent&acute;s were very activate in the church and continued
               to be so until they died. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Sunday would not
             be complete without a stop at the drug store. The only drug store
            in 
          this area of town was Bill Holmes&acute;s Ideal Sundry. Mr. Bill Holmes
           not only had the best lemonade in the county, but he also carried
          our 
          family from one Christmas to the next. Bill sold a variety of products.
           More like hardware, drug store, with lots of toys in the back of the
          
          store. </font></p>

        <p><font size="2">There was another favorite place that my Dad and I
            would go for Saturday lunch. Across the street from Bills Holmes&#8217;s
            (across the street from Greystone Church) was a small grill named
            Fent&acute;s Place.
          Fent Garrard made the best-minced pork sandwiches and very sweet, chocolate
          pie. I didn't realize until I was grown that it was actually chopped
        barbecue.<br>
        </font><font size="2"><br>
        The next street over from Mammy&#8217;s and Pa's was 14th St. (now
            Rutherford St) Mammy&#8217;s brother Oscar Thompson lived there his
            family. Uncle Oscar and my dad worked together in the mill for a
            while. Every Sunday, our whole family went to visit both sets of
            grandparents.
            (even though we had seen them several times during the week). On
            the way, we would stop at Uncle Oscar&#8217;s. But only if we saw
            some of them outside on the porch or in the yard. And we would never
            stop
            if Mom thought they &quot;had company&#8221;. It just simply would
            not be the polite thing to do. <br>
            <br>
          Let&#8217;s go up Rutherford Street, by the railroad tracks. We can
            go a couple of ways. Let&#8217;s turn right. This will take us to
            Pettigrew Street. Pettigrew is most interesting. I can see a very,
            very large
            railroad embankment. Very steep. We were never, never allowed to
            go up to the train tracks. That was certain doom. If not from the
            train,
            from my mother.<br>
            <br>
          However, if we were careful, we could pick wild blackberries that
            grew on the railroad banks. A lot of wild honeysuckle also grew on
            the banks.
            The warm summer wind would mix up these fragrances and send them
            though an open window at night. There was never a need for air freshner.
            She
            provided that for us too. <br>
            <br>
          My Mammy&#8217;s old home place was on Pettigrew St. Remember back,
            I told you that Nola had seven brothers and sisters. In the beginning,
            they all lived with their mamma (Grandma Thompson), her husband,
          and from time to time Grandma Thompson&#8217;s two sisters. <br>
            <br>
          As the children would marry, the new husband or wife would move into
            the house on Pettigrew Street, until they could make it on their
            own. More times than not, some stayed and had their own children
            there. <br>
            <br>
          I remember Mammy telling me that when they all lived on Pettigrew
            Street, the girls use to sleep head to toe, so they could make more
            room in
            the bed for more children. It was very important to have plenty of
            quilts for the bedrooms were all upstairs and unheated. Old clothes
            were used to make these quilts. Some quilts often told the childhood
            of one of the children growing up.<br>
            <br>
          Naturally at meal time everyone could not sit at the table at the
            same time. First to eat were any men. They had worked hard all day,
            then
            other grown-ups, and last the children. I think this is where &quot;take
            a cold biscuit and wait&quot; came from. If you stuck you finger
            in the biscuit poured in a little sugar and hot coffee, you would
            have
            an instant dessert! That would hold you over until you actually got
            a place at the table.<br>
            <br>
          The table was no place for conversation and foolishness. My Dad told
            me that Grandpa Thompson would not put up with any large amounts
            of conversation or absolutely no laughing. You would be sent away
            without
            finishing your food</font><br>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">A few houses down
             from "the old home place" was the house that Nola&acute;s sister
             moved  into. Ila (Thompson-Wallace) Fields live there. It was only
             one house 
          away from Southside School. This is where all of the neighborhood kids
              went to school. My Dad went to school there when it was 1-12th
             grade. 
          However, when my brother and me went, it was 1-7th. </font></p>

          Greystone Baptist church. My father was William E. Marlow aka: Billy,
          Bill, William Earl, and Whitey. My mom always called him Whitey (because
          of his blonde hair) His mom, Nola, called him Billy or William Earl.
          His father, Frank usually called him Son, when talking to him directly
          and &quot;your daddy&quot; when talking to me and my brother, Barry.<br>
          My mom, Pansy Ruth Clayton lived on Broad Street across from what is
          now the Duke's East Campus. She has told me how she and her sister,
          Mary, use to swing like monkeys in the tops of the big trees that grew
          on Broad Street. Today tennis courts occupy that space on the East
          Campus. She too had a corner store -- Ralph Rickets, on the corner
        of Broad and Markham. </font></p>

          Every Christmas the families always received a large basket of fresh
                fruit and nuts. You know I am not sure why, probably because
            we couldn&acute;t 
            afford it, but we never had fresh fruit or nuts in our house except
                for around the Christmas holiday. It was a real treat. And it
            came from 
            the mill. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">There were a few
             years during the end of the 50&acute;s and early 60&acute;s that
             the  Mill gave all of the families with children bags of toys. Depending
             
          on the age of the child and the gender depended on the type of toys
              you got in your brown grocery bag. Looking back these must have
             been 
          incredible lucrative years for the mill. This was most expensive and
              was probably in lieu of profit sharing. Santa Claus was always
             there 
          handing out these presents. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">My dad started
             in the mill as a fixer, like his father before him. However, with
            a 
          high school education and a little college, Dad moved up fairly quickly
             to supervisor and then to overseer. Familiar names he worked with
            were: 
          Jesse Boyce, Ralph Carrington, and Red Smith, others that I can&acute;t
           remember. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Dad was the overseer
             in charge of the weave room. The problem this presented was that
            Dad 
          was now in the management ranks. Mom however worked in the sewing room
             as a inspector. Quickly we are developing another Norma Rae... The
            mill 
          would not let Mother join the union due to the fact that Daddy was "management." 
          This was OK with her, she reaped the same benefits without the union
           dues, but some of her peers were not as happy. Never-the-less, some
          
          of her life time friends worked with her in the sewing room and the
           friendship won out over everything else. They even found out that
          it 
          was a good thing to have a close friend on the "management" team. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">At that time we
             lived in the house at 2006 Acme Street, it was a typical mill house.
            
          No under-pinning. One bath, two bedrooms, a den, a living room, a large
             kitchen and a small back porch. The back porch was large enough
            for 
          the washer and refrigerator. We had an eat-in kitchen (always green
             or yellow) with the red and white block tile. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">I remember the
             table and chairs looked like something out of Donna Reed. There
            was 
          an oil heating stove in the kitchen, but most of the time we would
            turn  on the oven and open the door. The oven heated the kitchen
            faster than 
          the oil stove. The kitchen is where my brother and I dressed every
            morning  for school. It was also the center and heartbeat of all
            activities within 
          the house.</font></p>

            ca. 1940: </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">There was a long
             hall way which all of the other room&acute;s led from. The one thing
              I never understood is why the bathrooms lined up so perfectly even
             with 
          the front door. It was a straight shot, so the decision to close the
              door or not was never an option. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The front and back yard was big. On the side of our
            house, facing the Anderson Street, was a triangle shaped, cement
            poured goldfish
          pond. This pond had a beautiful rock garden around it made from quartz
          rock. We always had orange fan-tailed goldfish. They would freeze in
          the water during the winter and begin to swim with the first thawing
          of the spring sunshine. <br>
          <br>
          That is until that one spring, Easter, when the Easter Bunny brought
          me a little colored duck. Elmer. Elmer didn&#8217;t die immediately
          like most of the pink, green, and blue little chicks, that were popular
          during the Easter season in the late 50&acute;s. Elmer actually thought
          he was a dog and would follow me up and down Acme Street. This lasted
          though out the entire summer. <br>
          <br>
By the end of the summer Elmer had grown into a full size duck. One day Elmer
discovered the fish in the goldfish pond, unfortunately this was also the day
Elmer decided that he really was a duck and not a pet dog. Mamma came outside
the next morning before going to work to also make that discovery on her own.
Her beautiful fan-tailed goldfish were floating little fish bones. <br>
<br>
Elmer was banished to live on my Aunt Bessie&acute;s farm &quot;out in the country&quot; after
that. I am still suspicions of the duck dinner she invited us to the next weekend.
Mamma turned down the invitation. She said it &quot;just not right.&quot; I have
never eaten duck in my life.<br>
<br>
Our house on Acme Street had the most beautiful embankment of thrift growing
on it -- white, pink and light blue. People would stop on their way up and down
Acme Street to look at it. We also had a large sandbox between two trees and
a swing set Barry and I always played on. Again, under the house was also a shady,
cool place to make roads and have an imagination store to sell your mud pies. <br>
<br>
A very large and wonderful wisteria vine grew on a large trestle, from the ground
to the roof of the house, directly outside the kitchen window. Sweetpeas grew
in the backyard, along with the Dogwood tree. This tree grew crooked. Mamma said
it was because we planted it on Sunday. This is the same poor Dogwood tree my
brother kept running over and over again in his homemade go-cart. Of course this
is the same go-cart that Daddy made and wired the left and right steering backwards.
So, when you turned left it went right. When you turn right, it went left. This
was a lot for a six year-old to remember. Poor Dogwood tree. A lawn mower motor
carries a lot of speed when it is wired backwards. I am still carrying a scar
from when I drove the go-cart under the picnic-table. I was banished, by my brother,
from the go-cart after that. <br>
<br>
Our Acme St house actually faced Acme Street, so did the front steps that lead
to the road on Acme Street. But you couldn&#8217;t get there by car from Acme
St. The entrance to these houses was from a back road behind the houses. It wasn&#8217;t
paved but covered in coal clinkers. This was the little street I first practice
my driving abilities. At 13 &frac12; I was allowed to drive the one and only
family Rambler station wagon with automatic, push button transmission, slowly,
up and down the back road to our house. <br>
<br>
One day, after traveling at 4 mph, I got a little zealous... and the dogwood
tree was wishing the go-cart was back. Not only did I run over the poor tree,
but also, smashed the picnic table and ran over a 50 gallon metal trash barrel
which promptly got stuck underneath the car. It was an ugly mess. <br>
Dad had gotten another promotion, which meant we moved again. We lived almost
at the corner of Anderson and Erwin Road. This house was a huge two-story house
with a front porch across the entire front of the house. It had 32 windows. My
mother was very upset. She had no idea where all of the curtains were going to
come from. I did. She used old pieces of sheets and pillowcases from the mill
to make the curtains herself. We had a lot of things made from old sheets and
pillowcases, short sets, curtains, pocketbooks and more. At least everything
matched!<br>
<br>
In true &quot;Mill&quot; tradition, the very large eat-in kitchen was painted
green. There was a &frac12; bath downstairs and a full bath upstairs. Upstairs
also had four bedrooms. There was no air conditioning. In the summer it was so
hot, we would sleep on the floor in the downstairs living room. The front porch
was the favorite place to sit at night. <br>
<br>
We would watch the cars go up and down Erwin Road. This was great for me at 13.
These cars were mainly on their way to &quot;The Blue Light&quot; on Erwin Road.
This was a popular hang out for boys! I was certainly in heaven. <br>
Around 1971 Burlington Industry sold the property to Duke University. This was
the same time I got married and moved away from home. The Durham Freeway came
thru this area and the rest for me as I remember it is history: The history of
Old
West
Durham Neighborhood.</font></p>
