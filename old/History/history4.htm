          attractions of Erwin Park (near present-day Duke School for Children) 
          was a metal cage with several monkeys inside. Employees at Erwin Auditorium 
          cared for the animals and during a feeding, two monkeys accidentally 
          jumped out of the cage. The monkeys ran across Erwin Road and down into 
          a pasture that Hoy and Charity Eudy used for their cows, sheep and goats 
          (Mr. Eudy was a Weaver at Erwin Mills). The monkeys were never caught 
          and as a result, the area around Swift and Case became known as "Monkey 
          Bottom." </p>

          of the Mill Village in Durham, by Osha Gray Davidson, <i><b>The Best 
          of Enemies: Race and Redemption in the New South</b></i> (Scribner).</font> 
        </p>
        <p>The houses were surprisingly alike on either side of this crucial dividing 
          line [railroad tracks separating white Durham from black]: small, dark, 
          and cramped. They had front porches in identical states of disrepair, 
          tin roofs warped and rusted to a similar dull red hue, and flyblown 
          outhouses in each dirt backyard. At night these houses glowed with the 
          flickering yellow light of kerosene lanterns that lent the district 
          an aura considered quaint -- by those who didn't have to live there... 
        <p>African-Americans have always occupied the lowest level of the Southland's 
          great social pyramid, but as the new century progressed the region seemed 
          unable to decide who it despised more: blacks or poor whites... Mill 
          employees labored at dangerous jobs under miserable conditions -- and 
          for poverty wages -- breathing in cotton dust until their lungs were 
          brown with the stuff and they suffocated... Before long, workers were 
          simply born into mill life and very few escaped it. And although it 
          was their underpaid labor that transformed Durham into the Jewel of 
          the New South, their presence in "better areas" of town was not welcome. 
          On rare occasions that they ventured out of their neighborhoods, mill 
          hands were immediately recognized by their deathly white pallor. Passing 
          them on the street, businessmen might smile to one another and exchange 
          a single sharp-edged word: "linthead." 
        <p>... The paternalism that governed relations between white planters 
          and slaves in the Old South was extended in the New South to include 
          poor white factory workers. In the early days, mill owners greeted workers 
          by their first name each morning, inquiring about the health of children, 
          who might also be known by their name. If a worker fell ill, the mill 
          boss would often pay the doctor's bill. One owner hired a full-time 
          nurse to care for workers and their families. When a smattering of education 
          was considered a good thing for workers, some mills offered classes 
          at night at no charge. Like a stern but caring "daddy," William Erwin, 
          the tall bespectacled president of the Erwin Cotton Mills, pedaled his 
          bicycle around the mill village in West Durham in the evenings, enforcing 
          a 10 P.M. "lights-out" rule. For the workers he referred to as "my people," 
          Erwin built a huge auditorium where they attended concerts and plays, 
          movies and flower shows. Later he added a swimming pool, tennis courts, 
          and even a small zoo. 
        <p>Erwin's beneficence, however, did not silence the rising critics of 
          a system that traded informal "favors" for complete submission to the 
          owner's authority. "His mill villages are better than most other companies," 
          admitted one union leader, "but he preaches baths, swimming pools, and 
          that kind of thing and then won't pay a wage that is anything near even 
          a living wage." </p>
