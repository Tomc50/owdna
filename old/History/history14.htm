        <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>By Billy B. Olive</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">One cannot write 
          about the period of 1928 to 1934 without relating this period to the 
          very drastic financial strain placed on most families. I will thus recite 
          just a few memories of what it meant to live in old West Durham during 
          the Depression. Finding housing at a price that could be afforded was 
          a challenge for my father particularly. To save expenses, we had to 
          share our house with my mother's sister's family.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">As my father sought 
          cheaper rents, I remember the tears when both families had to move from 
          a nice location on Englewood Avenue, which my parents owned, to three 
          successive rented locations in old West Durham (including a house on 
          Ninth Street). The fact that this same experience befell many others 
          helped soften the blow for my parents. However, as part of a large family, 
          there was much excitement when we moved to a new house. As I look back, 
          I can see that character was being molded. </font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Flour bags &amp; 
          shoes </b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Depression 
          affected our family in many other ways. My mother made and fed the family 
          many biscuits and for this we found it economical to buy flour by the 
          bag at two small neighborhood stores on either side of Hillsborough 
          Road (near where Strawbridge Studios are today). </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Choosing the particular 
          bag of flour to be purchased became a matter of choosing the particular 
          brand of flour which was bagged in the most attractive print suitable 
          for conversion to some kind of garment. All the manufacturers of flour 
          soon learned that their customers were using flour bags as an important 
          source of cloth for making items such as underwear, towels, shirts, 
          handkerchiefs and the like and our family, by necessity, became part 
          of this cycle. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Shoe soles were 
          expensive to buy when shoes needed to be repaired and while stick-on 
          shoe soles were available in the "5 and 10" cent store for perhaps 10 
          cents, such amount was not always available when a hole appeared in 
          a shoe. Thus, a common expedient at the start of each day when shoes 
          could not be repaired was to cut out a piece of cardboard to fit the 
          inside of the shoe as a temporary sole and which would usually last 
          for a day. As I look back, I can see that I was being taught some basic 
          lessons in economics. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Dog days of 
          summer</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">A cheap way to 
          a void the expense of the City building a swimming pool for use during 
          the hot summer days involved the local firemen. Thus, a common practice 
          of firemen to the delight of children in West Durham was to connect 
          a fire hose to a fire hydrant on Alabama Avenue, attach a fire nozzle 
          to the hose and elevate the nozzle so that children could dash in and 
          out of water sprayed from the nozzle. Such experiences undoubtedly built 
          up respect for the firemen in the minds of the children. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">While not related 
          to the Depression, there were many other interesting experiences in 
          old West Durham that delighted the children. One such experience involved 
          the iceman who would deliver blocks of ice to be stored in people's 
          ice boxes as a source of cooling. The iceman who was the greatest favorite 
          among the children was the iceman who knew how to skillfully use his 
          ice pick on a hot summer day so that every child got a least one chip 
          of ice on which to suck. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><img src="../graphics/history/f016.jpg" width="466" height="126"></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font color="Navy">Seven 
          ice trucks (ca. 1930): The Durham Public Service Company not only furnished 
          ice but also operated Durham's transportation and and electrical systems. 
          The Duke Power Co. later took over the electrical and transportation 
          facilities. Public Service Co. of N.C. is the name now used by the distributor 
          of natural gas. </font></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Disease in the 
          community</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Another memory 
          relates to how infectious diseases were publicized in the West Durham 
          community. When anyone in a family came down with any one of several 
          diseases such as influenza, measles, chicken pox or mumps, a sign of 
          a particular color would be tacked onto the front of the house with 
          a warning to all visitors.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Needless to say, 
          the removal of such a sign was always an event to be welcomed particularly 
          in a large family since one child's sickness affected all members of 
          the family and its hardship had to be shared. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>West Durham 
          Airport</b></font></p>

          for takeoff (Durham, ca. 1920). </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Another event which 
          I relate to West Durham concerns my first flight in an airplane which 
          took place at what was then called the West Durham Airport and whose 
          counterpart was the then existing East Durham Airport. The beginning 
          of the runway for the West Durham Airport began just west of the intersection 
          of the present Albany and Sovereign Streets and went downhill generally 
          towards Alabama Avenue and over much of what is now the Hillandale Golf 
          Course. </font></p>

          called E Street).</font></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">On this particular 
          day, a friend and myself somehow got up our "nerve" and the necessary 
          $10 charge and we found ourselves seated side by side in a Ford Trimotor 
          aircraft. With a roar, we went bumping down the dirt runway and took 
          off skimming over the trees on Club Boulevard. It was an experience 
          I have never forgot and which, while it is my fondest recollection of 
          the West Durham Airport, is only one of my experiences associated with 
          the West Durham Airport. I particularly recall seeing a stunt man walking 
          on the wing of a biplane and a parachutist making his downward fall 
          with a white plume which was probably a bag of flour being dumped. </font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">A special place 
          remains in my store of memories for the West Durham Lumber Company. 
          As a young boy interested in building a rabbit box, a skate scooter 
          or something similar, I was always able to find a friend at the West 
          Durham Lumber Company who would give me a few scrap boards or handful 
          of nails and send me on my way with a word of encouragement. Such experiences 
          helped keep me usefully occupied and perhaps taught me many other things.

          Road in 1929 (Durham Public Service Co.)</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the old days, 
          Hillandale Road was a narrow, unpaved dirt road which provided a place 
          for stunts to be performed and witnessed. At one time, a two-man stunt 
          team drove an old, probably a Dodge, touring car. The car would start 
          at the top of the hill on Hillandale Road at its intersection with Hillsborough 
          Road. One of the men would be driving and the other man would be standing 
          blindfolded on the car's running board next to the side of the road 
          and in a crouched position. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">At some critical 
          time, indicated by the driver with a flourish and related to the relatively 
          slow speed and loud noise of the car, the blindfolded stunt man would 
          jump off the car, tumble in the dirt and then would remove his blindfold, 
          stand and bow to the crowd with great applause. A passing of a hat and 
          collection of donations would follow. I remember trying to figure out 
          how this could all happen repeatedly with no apparent injury to the 
          stunt man. </font></p>

          to Town</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The old circus 
          ground used to be at a Hillsborough Road location now occupied by a 
          Kroger Store and a shopping center. The Ringling Brothers Barnum and 
          Bailey circus would unload its rail cars opposite the East Duke Campus 
          and would march the animals and circus vehicles to the circus ground. 
          One day it was particularly hot when the circus arrived and word went 
          out that with the animals being thirsty, a free ticket would be given 
          to anyone who showed up with an empty washtub at the fire hydrant located 
          at the intersection of Hillandale and Hillsborough Road. Needless to 
          say, the tubs arrived, the animals got watered and many children in 
          the community enjoyed a free circus matinee. (<a href="history14.htm#news">see newspaper

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Memories of E.K. 
          Powe School recall a practice of requiring all the students to listen 
          to an approximately one-hour radio program of music called, as I recall, 
          the "Walter Damrosch Hour." It was here that we learned about sharps, 
          flats, musical terms and musical instruments all of which has lasted 
          through the years. I remember always looking forward to this wonderful 
          hour and learning about some of the mysteries of music. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Fire Chief Frank 
          Bennett visited E.K. Powe and sang songs which caught our attention 
          and effectively taught us the dangers of oily rags and how a magnifying 
          glass could start a fire. Even today, I find myself very sensitive to 
          fire hazards. </font></p>

          in life, the writer, Billy B. Olive, went on to become a graduate of

          'incredible human gyro' who swung dangerously on a trapeze while balanced 
          on his head; Maximilliano Truzzi, the greatest juggler since Rastelli; 
          the world renowned Cristiani Family with Lucio, the greatest riding 
          comedian of all time; and Hugo Zacchini, the mild-mannered 'human cannonball' 
          who loves to paint landscapes with political meaning. The circus also 
          boasts several side shows, and a menagerie composed of elephants, a 
          giraffe, assorted cats, at least two hyenas, baboons, and other wild 
          beasts.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#000000"><em>&quot;Each Christmas my family enjoyed seeing 
          the city reservoir at the end of West Club Boulevard. Members of the 
          Durham Fire Department constructed a huge tree made of strings of colored 
          lights over the water. I never understood how they accomplished this 
          feat. During the 1970s when my grandchild was growing up near the reservoir, 
          one of her little friends asked her father what the precious little 
          building in the reservoir was. He said it was Santa Claus' summer home. 
          It still stands there.&quot; -Edna Baker</em></font></p>

        <p><strong>Mashed Potato Candy<br>
          </strong>(Depression-era candy made in some West Durham kitchens)</p>
        <p>* One-half cup of leftover mashed potatoes (not instant) </p>
        <p>* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract </p>
        <p>* 28 ounces powdered sugar (1.75 sixteen-ounce boxes) </p>
        <p>* Smooth peanut butter </p>
        <p>In a mixing bowl, combine the leftover mashed potatoes, the vanilla 
          and one cup of powdered sugar. Set the remaining powdered sugar (about 
          20 ounces) aside.</p>
        <p>Stir until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture becomes a thin syrup. 
          Continue adding powdered sugar into the mix, while stirring thoroughly. 
          As the remaining sugar is added, the mixture will become very stiff 
          and difficult to stir.</p>
        <p>Remove mixture from bowl and place on a sheet of waxed paper that is 
          coated with powdered sugar. Dust a rolling pin with powdered sugar and 
          roll out the mixture like a pizza crust (about 18 inches in diameter).</p>
        <p>Using a spatula, spread a generous amount of peanut butter on the mashed 
          potato candy and curl it up tightly, like a jellyroll. Wrap candy in 
          waxed paper, and refrigerate for three or four hours. Cut into half-inch 
          slices and serve. </p>
