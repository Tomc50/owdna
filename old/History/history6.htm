        <font size="2">Magnolia Grill (the original Wellspring Grocery location). 
          For years, Floyd Wright operated a grocery on this corner (in the small 
          frame building that now stands behind the Magnolia Grill -- facing West 
          Knox Street). According to Tom Walker, long-time County Commissioner 
          Dewey Scarboro built the existing brick building in 1947. Across the 
          street from EK Powe School, Scarboro Grocery was a favorite stop for 
          children for some 40 years. Mr. Scarboro closed his store in 1978 and 
          an Old West Durham institution, Wellspring Grocery, sold its first produce 
          through these doors. Today, this old neighborhood grocery store is home 
          to one of the South's most acclaimed restaurants -- Magnolia Grill. </font></font></p>

      <font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This neighborhood 
        store was located in the 2600 Block of Hillsborough Rd. and was operated 
        by Mr. A.W. &quot;Bill&quot; Holmes from 1946 to 1949. The business 
        was then moved across the street and continued to operate under the 
        same name until 1986.</font> <font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Bill,

      During World War II, Fent's Place moved to a spot on Hillsboro Road,

      resident Moe Utley recalls working at Forrest Grocery and Wallace Lumber 
      Yard on Rosehill for 10 cents an hour. He also worked at Ideal Sundry 
      for 15 cents an hour, delivering goods to neighborhood homes. Today,

    Old Garrard's Grocery Store, 2606 Hillsborough Road (across from Greystone 
    Baptist)</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">Built in the very early 1900s, this building has mostly 
    served as a neighborhood grocery -- starting as Garrard's Grocery Store. 
    Long-time resident Bill Holmes recalls Garrett's mule-drawn wagon that 
    delivered groceries to the nearby homes in the West Durham mill village. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2">Haygood Grocery Store then occupied the building for 
    many years. At one point the owners realized that a local ordinance 
    stipulated they were too close to Greystone Baptist to sell liquor. 
    The solution was to build a partition right down the middle of the store 
    and punch out a second door out front. The new door was far enough away 
    from the church to allow the sale of liquor.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">A plumbing store was later replaced by a Chinese Grocery 
    store for several years until it closed in 1985 (about the same time 
    the mills shut down). A shop that printed tee-shirts (and offered shoe 
    shines out front) operated for awhile before the building stood vacant 
    for a period of time.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">Over the years, different users of Garrard's Grocery 
    had added stud walls and an eight-foot high ceiling to divide the space 
    into numerous small, dark rooms. The original brickwork had been covered 
    with stucco, and paneling had been installed over that. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2">Today, the old Garrard's Grocery is the home of Fisher 
    Signs. Owner Mitch Fisher extensively restored the historic building. 
    He removed all newer interior walls to expose 10-foot high tongue and 
    groove heart of pine ceilings and sandblasted the stucco to expose the 
    original brick. The efforts to restore this important neighborhood building 
    led to OWDNA bestowing its &quot;Pinhook Award&quot; to Mitch Fisher for his inspirational 
    efforts.</font> </p>

  <p>Once upon a time, for most people at least, there were no cars, refrigerators 
    were unheard of and ice-boxes were doubtful, tiny affairs. In those 
    days the institution of the neighborhood grocery story, just around 
    the corner as it was, solved most people's food storage and mobility 
    problems. Time, perniciously, moved on, however, and cars, refrigerators, 
    deep chest freezers, supermarkets, Sam's and hanger-sized Costco stores 
    have rendered the neighborhood grocery obsolete.</p>
  <p>This leaves most older neighborhoods with a problem--what to do with 
    the building which once housed the eggs, the canned goods, the produce, 
    and the cokes in those little bottles. These buildings are everywhere 
    throughout Durham -- often right in amongst the homes they once served. 
    Usually, they can't be homes themselves -- although we've honored notable 
    exceptions -- and they can't be retail shops again --zoning and neighbors 
    prevent that. Sometimes, they sit empty and useless and sometimes new 
    owners and new ideas bring new life.</p>
  <p><a href="history6.htm#garrett">Garrard's Grocery</a> on Hillsborough Road was built 
    in the early part of the century to serve the huge Erwin Mill Village 
    that surrounded it. Mill workers passed it on their foot-bound journeys 
    to and from work. Garrett's mule-drawn produce wagon ambled up and down 
    the dusty streets. After Garrett's came Haygood's grocery. Haygood measured 
    the distance from Greystone Baptist and discovered that his store was 
    too close for lawful liquor sales. Ingeniously, he partitioned the building 
    into two halves and put in a second door out front. This door was just 
    beyond the line, and Haywood did a rollicking business.</p>
  <p>When the grocery business moved on, the building went searching for 
    a purpose. Such buildings can be dangerous for neighborhoods. New owners 
    are seldom content to operate within the limited confines of an obsolete 
    retail idea. They want bigger and better.</p>
  <p>Fortunately for West Durham, Mitch Fisher acquired the Garrard's Grocery 
    building, renovated it, and moved his sign shop and framing studio into 
    it. The building has been much altered over time, but Mitch saved the 
    remaining wood floors and bead board ceiling. </p>
  <p>Mitch's business seems to be the perfect, low-key match for the neighborhood. 
    In fact, he's a big supporter of the Old West Durham Neighborhood Association. 
    The prominent neighborhood sign at the corner of Markham and Ninth is 
    just one of his gifts to his neighbors. We at the society mark his solution 
    to the &quot;neighborhood grocery problem&quot; with a Neighborhood Conservation 
    award.</p>
