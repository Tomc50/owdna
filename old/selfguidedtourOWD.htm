            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Why is Ninth Street called 
              Ninth Street? What song writer for Norah Jones was 'born on a kitchen 
              table' near the East Campus wall? Where did Richard Nixon live as a 
              Duke Law student? What's the origin of Walltown? Where did Elvis go 
              to lose weight? Take this self-guided tour and find out. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We'll begin at the opening 
              in the East Campus wall across from Whole Foods Market (Broad &amp; 
              Perry). Your route will follow the gravel path by the East Campus wall 
              (built in 1916) and offer forays into the surrounding neighborhoods. 
              The tour, including a stop on Ninth Street for a drink, will take less 
              than an hour.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Stop #1) Broad &amp; 
              Perry, break in East Campus wall: </b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Why does the stone wall 
              around East Campus stop for a stretch along Broad Street? </font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Before West Campus was built 
              in the late 1920s, the Duke (rather, Trinity College) football team 
              played their home games at Hanes Field -- named after the Winston-Salem 
              benefactor who made underwear. A red-brick wall with several ticket 
              windows facing Broad Street stood where the cedar trees now grow tall. 
              When the old wall started to tilt in the 1980s, it was torn down. The 
              field hockey team now plays here and Hanes Field has a new name -- Williams 
              Field.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Across the street is the 
              neighborhood of Old West Durham, a turn-of-the-century mill village 
              that is a national historic district. Today, it is home to Ninth Street, 
              Magnolia Grill, Durham's oldest fire station and oldest pizza restaurant, 
              the Erwin Mills cemetery, and more than 80 different Duke operations. </font></p>

              Mill is on the left (where the three railroad spurs extend north into 
              the mills). The West Durham mill village is north, west and south of 
              the mills. Walltown and Trinity Heights are north of the college while

            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Stop #2) Corner of Broad 
              &amp; West Main: </b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The large gray houses across 
              the street belonged to managers of the nearby cotton mills. In the early 
              days, living alongside the rail road tracks was considered desirable. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Beyond the gray houses was 
              the African American settlement of Brookstown. A hundred years ago, 
              a brick yard (owned by the Fitzgerald's -- one of Durham's many successful 
              African American families) made bricks for most of the tobacco factories 
              and textile mills. Today, the old brick yard is the site of Duke's Freeman 
              Center. Like Hayti and Hickstown, Brookstown was torn apart when the 
              Durham Freeway was built through the community in the 1970s and 80s. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The hamlet of Pinhook was 
              located near the large pinkish gray Erwin Square tower to the west. 
              Established before 1850 (and before Durham existed), Pinhook was half-way 
              between the old colonial capital in Hillsborough and the new state capital 
              in Raleigh. The camp ground and tavern was a 'roaring old place' where 
              travelers could relax after a long day's walk.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Stop #3) Free-speech 
              tunnel and West Main Street: </b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">From 1887 to 1902, street 
              cars were pulled by mules along tracks on West Main Street (from downtown 
              to Erwin Mills). In 1903, the mules were replaced with electric trolleys. 
              A small loop was built around the southern end of the Ninth Street shopping 
              district and the trolley tracks were extended north up Broad Street 
              and west along Club Blvd. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Across the railroad tracks 
              and through the trees stands Duke's Center for Documentary Studies. 
              The two-story white frame building is dedicated to advancing documentary 
              work and connecting the arts and humanities to fieldwork and community 
              life (via photography, filmmaking, oral history, folklore, and writing). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Stop #4) Main entrance 
              and quad: </b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Look all the way up the 
              quad to Baldwin Auditorium. This area of East Campus roughly follows 
              the shape of the horse race track that was here before 1892, on the 
              grounds of the old Blackwell Fairgrounds. A horse raised here named 
              Baxter took third place in the Kentucky Derby.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">After Meredith College declared 
              it wouldn't locate in a 'rum-soaked mill village' -- Durham business 
              leaders Julian S. Carr and Washington Duke topped Raleigh's offer of 
              Pullen Park and $25,000 with the offer of these 62 acres and $85,000 
              for buildings and endowment to bring Trinity College to the Bull City 
              in 1892. (Good thing too, Duke historians say the college would likely 
              not have survived the Depression of 1893 had it remained in Randolph 
              County.) </font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 1905, President Teddy 
              Roosevelt's train stopped across from the East Campus entrance. His 
              arrival from Raleigh was announced in Durham by the sounds of factory 
              whistles in East Durham. Other industries and locomotives joined the 
              commotion with their whistles. It was all too loud for much of a speech 
              downtown. When he stopped here, Roosevelt extolled the college's recent 
              courageous stand for academic freedom (Bassett Affair) and remarked, 
              &quot;As I came in, gentlemen, I felt as if I was at a football contest.&quot; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Just past the rail road 
              tracks is the Smith Warehouse. The largest of the 12 warehouses operated 
              by Liggett &amp; Myers Tobacco Co, it will soon to be transformed into 
              Duke class rooms and offices. Brightleaf Square (old tobacco district) 
              and downtown rise to the east.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Stop #5) Grove of magnolia 
              trees and Sower statue: </b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The original entrance road 
              onto East Campus ran straight through the grove of magnolia trees. Look 
              back to the grey stone building and you'll see large trees lined up 
              on either side of the old roadway (on either side of the Sower statue).</font></p>

              Sower, courtesy of Duke Photography</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> </font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Hidden behind the large 
              magnolia tree in the back is the Ann Roney fountain (ca. 1901). This 
              tribute is important because Ann Roney took care of Washington Duke's 
              two sons after their mother died. The Duke family went on to become 
              the university's major benefactor, building West Campus and changing 
              Trinity's name to Duke. [Today, this fountain has no plaque, no indication 
              of the role Ms. Roney played in Duke's history. Getting a plaque made 
              would be a wonderful project for a student group.] </font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Stop #6) Corner of Buchanan 
              &amp; Minerva, Trinity Park: </b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">At the small break in the 
              wall, cross Buchanan Blvd and walk up Minerva Ave into the neighborhood 
              of Trinity Park.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Although many of Trinity 
              Park's early settlers were connected with Trinity College, the majority 
              were merchants, businessmen and professionals. In contrast to Durham's 
              late 19th-century neighborhoods, fewer Trinity Park residents were directly 
              associated with tobacco and textiles. They were part of the broader 
              local economy produced by their families' successes in Durham's leading 
              industries. These younger generations chose not to live in the older 
              neighborhoods where they grew up close to Durham's industries. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Local tradition holds that 
              Elvis Presley went through drug rehab in the large red brick house with 
              green roof -- just south of Watts and Minerva. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Turn left on Watts Street 
              and walk up to the playground. Some of the oldest houses here were originally 
              located on campus for Trinity professors and later moved into the neighborhood.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Stop #7) Community park: </b> </font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the 1970s, developers 
              tried to build apartments on this corner. Neighbors mobilized, bought 
              the land and built this corner park instead. Farther up the street is 
              George W. Watts Elementary School -- the oldest brick school in Durham 
              (ca. 1919). Gothic hints can be seen in the neoclassical motifs at the 
              entrances and stepped parapets and buttressing on the facade. Turn left 
              at Urban St and walk back to East Campus.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Stop #8) The Ark: </b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Near the break in the wall 
              is a three-story, white-frame building called the Ark (by the East Campus 
              coffee house). Built of salvaged wood from the grandstands at the old 
              race track, it's called the Ark because students had to walk in pairs 
              to make it up the narrow entranceway. One of the first college basketball 
              games in the state of North Carolina took place here in 1906 (where 
              the sixth man was the iron columns in the middle of the court).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Following a &quot;humdinger&quot; 
              of a Southern Conference tournament in 1928, the Atlanta Journal wrote: 
              &quot;That Duke is going to be a big factor in conference is certain. They 
              have already done enough in basketball, whether they win the title or 
              not, to make their school remembered in Atlanta. In football, wrestling, 
              boxing, baseball and track, the baby member is going to make the old 
              timers look to their laurels. And we don't mean maybe.&quot; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Stop #9) Markham &amp; 
              Onslow, Trinity Heights: </b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Following the path around 
              the bend, walk out through the break in the wall near the Baldwin Auditorium 
              sign. This area of campus still shows the old curves of the horse race 
              track where the ground slopes.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Cross Markham and walk up 
              Onslow Street (to the north). One of the first planned residential developments 
              in Durham, Trinity Heights has traditionally been home for folks from 
              a broad range of backgrounds and interests, including employees and 
              students of Trinity College.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This street is a wonderful 
              example of Duke's recent efforts to build quality in-fill houses in 
              an older neighborhood. Turn left onto Green Street.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Stop #10) Onslow &amp; 
              Green, Walltown: </b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Across Green Street is the 
              community of Walltown. In 1892, a young African-American man named George 
              Wall followed his job with Trinity College to Durham. Wall bought a 
              wooded plot of land north of what is now East Campus. Walltown became 
              a neighborhood for mostly African American workers moving into the Bull 
              City for jobs in the tobacco industry. The narrow shotgun houses and 
              small residences provided easy access to the tobacco factories. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Walltown's east-west streets 
              were lettered and its north-south streets were numbered. So, you're 
              now standing at what was once 3rd &amp; B streets. (Ninth Street is 
              called Ninth Street because of Walltown.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The neighborhood is crisscrossed 
              with deep gullies and creeks. When this area of Durham was first developed, 
              wealthy interests purchased the highlands for larger homes -- leaving 
              bottomlands for smaller dwellings in gullies. If you drive along the 
              length of Englewood Avenue, for instance, you'll see larger homes in 
              elevated areas, smaller homes down in the stream valley and bigger houses 
              back at the top of the next hill. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Stop #11) Green &amp; 
              Berkeley:</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">For many years, the block 
              between Berkeley and Sedgefield was mostly open space. Duke recently 
              developed the land by building homes for university employees. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">When Trinity College first 
              began making plans to expand and become Duke University in the 1920s, 
              administrators purchased this land and thought about extending the original 
              campus to the north. When word got out about Duke's plans, real estate 
              prices in Trinity Heights went through the roof. The idea was dropped 
              and school officials bought the Rigsbee farm to the southwest instead. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Had the expansion plans 
              been kept secret, Duke Chapel and the quad might have been located about 
              where you're standing now. Instead, the Blue Devils now face football 
              foes where the Rigsbee family kept their pigs -- on what is now West 
              Campus. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Take a look down Clarendon, 
              towards East Campus. When he was a Duke law student, Richard Nixon lived 
              in the two-story blue house at 814. This house originally stood a block 
              farther south where the field hockey team plays on East Campus.</font></p>

              John D. Loudermilk was 'born on a kitchen table' a block north of here 
              on Iredell. Loudermilk wrote some 1500 songs, including 'Tobacco Road' 
              (sung by Lou Rawls) and 'Turn Me On' (sung by nine-time Grammy winner, 
              Norah Jones).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the early days, the entire 
              area smelled like a Laundromat -- from the hot, soapy water being discharged 
              by the textile mills into what long-time neighbors called the &quot;dye ditch&quot; 
              (because it ran brightly colored when fabric, usually denim, was being 
              dyed). Today, Duke is helping the neighborhood create a quiet urban 
              greenspace along South Ellerbe Creek, near the elementary school.</font></p>

              West Durham. Long-time residents recall that a sawmill was placed in 
              the middle of the nearby woods to cut the planks to build the first 
              houses in the mill village. Company housing was modest with coal stoves 
              and running water. Most had electricity. Several Italian stonecutters 
              who helped build Duke's West Campus lived in this neighborhood.</font></p>

              Southern Living's best restaurants in the South -- Magnolia Grill (not 
              to be confused with the Mongolian grill across the way). The two-story 
              red brick building on your left is Ninth Street North -- a mix of retail 
              and office that recently replaced a block of old vacant storefronts. </font></p>

              have volunteered in Old West Durham -- doing everything from picking 
              up trash along creeks and railroad tracks to fixing up the elementary 
              school gardens and nearby Erwin Mills cemetery. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Turn left and head up Ninth 
              Street. Check out Durham's first Kentucky Fried Chicken at 806 9th Street. 
              The owner asked Colonel Sanders if he could call his franchise, &quot;Pete 
              Rinaldi's Kentucky Fried Chicken.&quot; The Colonel agreed -- making this 
              restaurant one of a few KFCs in the nation to carry its owner's name. 
              During his visits to the Duke Rice Diet, the Colonel enjoyed standing 
              next to his life-sized fiberglass likeness (accurate down to the eyeglasses 
              and Rotary pin) at the KFC and startle the beejeezus out of customers. 
              Today, an artist's studio occupies the space.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Just to the west, the Pizza 
              Palace is Durham's oldest pizza restaurant. On the corner, H&amp;K Printing 
              used to be a bakery that elderly residents say, &quot;smelled wonderful and 
              made the best donuts in town&quot;. Generations ago, Charlie's Sports Bar 
              was Pender's grocery store -- famous for its wagon that delivered goods 
              to the mill village. Peek-a-Boo Bar &amp; Grill ('Famous since 2003') 
              was the original Ninth Street Bakery.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Established in 1922, McDonald's 
              Drug Store is the oldest business on Ninth St. Dogstar Tattoo, was once 
              West Durham Cash Store which sold dry goods. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Regulator Bookshop was 
              originally Cheek's Dry Cleaner's. Folks thought the glass blocks were 
              a bit fancy for a mill village shopping district. Books on Ninth and 
              the Blue Corn Cafe were once Rambeau's Barber Shop and nearby was a 
              pool hall -- Ninth Street's roughest spot. Most neighborhood kids were 
              not allowed to pass through its doors. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Stop #16) Erwin Mills:</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The long red brick building 
              on the hill across the street seems to be an almost forgotten footnote 
              of history. And yet the Erwin Cotton Mills were the driving force that 
              made Old West Durham what it is today. Started by the Duke family the 
              same year Trinity College came to Durham (1892), the new company bought 
              several adjacent tracts of land and built the mills, picker building, 
              dyehouse, boiler room, and engine house. The steady noise of the mills 
              reverberated throughout the surrounding village. The humming roar so 
              pervaded the workers' consciousness that they noticed it only when it 
              ceased, making Sundays seem unnaturally still. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Past the old mill building, 
              the neighborhood spoke in favor of the development of high-density apartments 
              to help support the shops and restaurants here. Local lore holds that 
              Elvis Presley also lived incognito in a caboose on a railroad spur near 
              Jim's Party Store (Hillsborough Road &amp; Trent) while he was on the 
              Rice Diet in the late 1960s.</font></p>

              served as both Kime Barber Shop and the West Durham Beauty Shop. Art 
              Craft Framing was Morgan's Cafe for many years. The night of Martin 
              Luther King's assassination, the front of Morgan's Cafe was hit with 
              a lit gasoline-filled bottle. Farther down, Couch's Furniture Store 
              was burned to the ground. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Native Threads once housed 
              the popular Ruby's Cafe. Campus Florist was Brewer's Drug Store for

            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Brueggers Bagels is in 
              the old Fidelity Bank. A couple of two-story mill houses stood across 
              Ninth St from the old bank (where Specs is now located). Don Schlitz 
              grew up in one of these houses and went on to compose, &quot;The Gambler&quot; 
              -- the song made famous by Kenny Rogers that was eventually made into 
              a movie. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the 1920s, Ninth Street 
              was part of Old NC 10 --the first roadway that crossed the state (going 
              from the Atlantic coast to the Tennessee border).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Beyond the BP on West Main 
              St, you can see a rusty bridge over Ninth. This is the site of the future 
              Ninth Street commuter rail station that will connect this old mill village 
              with RTP and Raleigh. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Turn left onto Perry Street. 
              Once called Hillsboro Ave, Perry connects Ninth Street with East Campus 
              (just ahead). Durham's only bike shop is here as well as one of the 
              nine churches that was started in the mill village.</font></p>
