		<p><font size="3">Lured by dollar signs, senior officials at Duke University
		  have been talking about rezoning the university's Central Campus
		  in 
		  a way that goes beyond the academic mission of the university. </font></p>
		<p><font size="3">Since February 2003, the Duke-Durham Partnership neighborhoods
		  have worked hard to support rezonings for Duke's Medical Center,
		  East 
		  Campus and West Campus. Leaders of the neighborhoods around Duke supported
		  the redevelopment of Central Campus, an area between West Campus
		  and 
		  the medical center. We worked out with senior Duke officials a list
		  of retail uses we felt would be compatible with the neighborhoods--including
		  
		  three new restaurants, a performing arts center, a 99-room hotel, a
		  bowling alley, a Duke clothing store, new dorms and an on-campus
		  book 
		  store with coffee shop. The partnership neighborhoods then voted to
		  support this agreement. The list has remained unchanged ever since.</font></p>
		<p><font size="3">Duke then asked the partnership neighborhoods to acquiesce
		  on looming construction projects, such as an eye center, an addition
		  
		  to Perkins library and new East Campus dorms. We did.</font></p>
		<p><font size="3">We feel we've been quite reasonable in supporting Duke's
		  needs. In response, Duke has been less than neighborly.</font></p>
		<p><font size="3">Retail use supporting the academic mission of the university,
		  such as student restaurants or a campus bookstore, is appropriate.
		  But 
		  the partnership neighborhoods voted to oppose retail on Central Campus
		  that goes beyond academic retail, such as general clothing or jewelry
		  
		  stores. This sort of retail would have an unfair advantage over nearby
		  businesses because they wouldn't have to pay property taxes and
		  would 
		  undermine the surrounding community.</font></p>
		<p><font size="3">Duke, however, hasn't been working in good faith with
		  the community. At a March 10 forum in Trinity Heights, Duke officials
		  
		  acknowledged they're looking at more retail than the list we had worked
		  out.</font></p>
		<p><font size="3">Duke's intentions were confirmed when Duke executive
		  vice president Tallman Trask III said at the forum that Duke might
		  ask 
		  that Central Campus be zoned &quot;general commercial&quot; by the
		  city.  A general commercial designation, which would allow unlimited
		  retail, 
		  would be consistent with Duke's actions a year ago, when the university
		  architect went behind the partnership neighborhoods' backs to actively
		  
		  lobby the city's planning department to remove the term &quot;limited
		  retail&quot; from Durham's University-College ordinance.</font></p>
		<p><font size="3">For months, university officials have refused to share
		  details of their retail plans with the community. Why the secrecy?
		  Instead, 
		  Duke accused the neighborhood partners of spreading rumors that Duke
		  wanted to build more retail. Lo and behold, it appears we were right.</font></p>
		<p><font size="3">Bowing to community pressure, Duke is now saying it
		  might offset the loss of property taxes by working out some sort
		  of 
		  payment. Why create a special status for Duke retail? Why not just
		  pay  property taxes like all other Durham businesses? Why is Duke
		  trying 
		  to deny local jurisdictions revenue?</font></p>
		<p><font size="3">Creating an on-campus retail cocoon would exacerbate
		  the town-gown tensions that prompted the creation of the Duke-Durham
		  
		  partnership initiative, further isolating Duke students from Durham
		  by discouraging students from patronizing off-campus businesses.
		  A self-contained 
		  retail center at Central Campus would transform the Durham Freeway
		  into  a physical barrier between Duke's main campus and the bustling
		  commercial 
		  strip on Ninth Street. Why venture out to Ninth Street, Brightleaf
		  Square  or Northgate Mall when you can shop right on campus?</font></p>
		<p><font size="3">A graduate student recently said at a campus forum
		  that &quot;security&quot; at Duke means control of resources--keeping
		  students out of Durham and their money on Duke's campus. The university
		  has
		  now 
		  lowered its parking lot gates during off-hours and closed campus
		  streets. The inconvenience and expense of parking at Duke sends
		  a message that
		  
		  outsiders, such as Durham residents, are less welcome.</font></p>
		<p><font size="3">Reinforcing this message, Duke recently erected an
		  eight-foot  fence and gates along sections of its southern boundary
		  in order to, 
		  they say, protect parked cars. And a 45-year-old woman walking her
		  dog  on East Campus was recently stopped by a Duke police officer
		  who asked 
		  her: &quot;How long do you intend to be on campus?&quot;</font></p>
		<p><font size="3">All the while, Duke officials insist they have no intention
		  of isolating the campus.</font></p>
		<p><font size="3">With Duke, don't listen to what they say, look at what
		  they do. Throughout the retail discussions, Duke repeatedly claimed
		  
		  they care deeply about the Durham community. Yet, Duke got out of $596,000
		  in impact fees for their new construction and paid $847,000 less
		  than 
		  requested to help Durham cover local costs (figures represent what
		  the  city said Duke should pay minus what Duke eventually paid).
		  At the same 
		  time, Duke had no problem finding $500,000 to buy iPods for all incoming
		  students.</font></p>
		<p><font size="3">Duke contributes far less than Princeton, Harvard and
		  Brown universities pay to their host cities. This money could have
		  funded 
		  important projects in our community.</font></p>
		<p><font size="3">And while Duke says that all this new campus construction
		  won't have an impact on local traffic because it'll be offset by
		  regional 
		  rail, Duke repeatedly resisted a regional rail station at Duke Medical
		  Center.</font></p>
		<p>T<font size="3">heir wish came true when the Triangle Transit Authority
		  recently announced that the medical center station had been dropped
		  
		  from its plans for this stage. Since Duke is Durham's largest employer,
		  including thousands at the medical center, the station could have
		  helped 
		  keep cars off area streets.</font></p>
		<p><font size="3">With the loss of the TTA rail station at the medical
		  center, Duke's excuse for paying less to the city is no longer valid.
		  
		  So, Duke's check to help cover the local costs associated with its
		  new  construction must be in the mail.</font></p>
		<p><font size="3">Despite assurances by Duke officials at the March forum
		  that they'd try to better communicate their Central Campus plans
		  with 
		  the neighborhoods, we've heard nothing from Duke for nine months. We
		  then read on Nov. 29 in The Chronicle, the student newspaper, that
		  Duke's 
		  Board of Trustees was set to approve proposals for Central Campus.
		  Duke  officials say the article was wrong.</font></p>
		<p><font size="3">Duke could have set the record straight. One thing
		  this  episode shows is that Duke doesn't yet get that they need to
		  be proactive 
		  in contacting and sharing information with its partnership neighborhoods.</font></p>
		<p><font size="3">Since the March meeting, Duke officials have started
		  inviting new presidents of partnership neighborhoods to meetings.
		  The 
		  exclusion from this meeting of those with whom Duke had been negotiating
		  Central Campus plans for months raised suspicions that Duke was
		  trying 
		  to foster divisions between the partnership neighborhoods they say
		  they  want to help.</font></p>
		<p><font size="3">There is good news. The Chronicle of Higher Education
		  recently wrote an excellent <a href="http://chronicle.com/temp/reprint.php?id=19bb8nm6a4amlf6nwpy8g52tliza0bc1">article</a> describing
		  Duke's retail efforts. The Herald-Sun wrote an editorial saying
		  Duke has raised &quot;justifiable ire&quot; with its plans
		  for  Central Campus and needs to win back the neighborhoods' trust.</font></p>
		<p><font size="3">And, after months of discussions, the InterNeighborhood
		  Council of Durham, a group that links neighborhood associations
		  from 
		  across the city, voted this summer to support the position that the
		  new University-College District is the most appropriate zoning designation
		  
		  for Duke's Central Campus. The INC also supported the list of limited
		  retail uses that was worked out with Duke and endorsed by the partnership
		  
		  neighborhoods in 2003.</font></p>
		<p><font size="3">Just before the vote, Michael Palmer, Duke's director
		  of community affairs, tried to have the sentence supporting the
		  retail 
		  list removed from the position statement. He failed, and the measure
		  was passed. Despite Duke's effort to manipulate the INC's decision,
		  
		  the vote wasn't even close.</font></p>
		<p align="center"><font size="3">The INC vote represents a setback for
		  Duke's efforts to build on-campus retail that goes beyond the academic
		  
		  mission of the university. We know the City Council is paying attention.
		  We hope Duke's Board of Trustees is, too.</font></p>
		<p><font size="3">This year, Duke welcomed a new president, marking a
		  new beginning. Hopefully, Dr. Richard Brodhead will use this opportunity
		  
		  to clear the deck. Fulfilling two simple requests would help move things
		  in the right direction:</font></p>
		<p><font size="3">* Have Duke stick to the list of on-campus retail uses
		  the partnership neighborhoods worked out with the university and
		  later 
		  was supported by the InterNeighborhood Council.</font></p>
		<p><font size="3">* Move the Neighborhood Partnership Initiative out
		  of  the Public Affairs office (more concerned about Duke's image
		  than finding 
		  real solutions to problems) and into an area of the president's office
		  with more substance. Then, maybe we can bring the word &quot;partnership&quot; back
		  into the mix.</font></p>
		<p><font size="3">And maybe we can clear the air and move forward. Then,
		  maybe Duke can go back to focusing on academics and not undermine
		  Durham 
		  with its on-campus retail schemes.</font></p>
