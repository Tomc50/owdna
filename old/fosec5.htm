  Creek, E.K. Powe PTA, Ninth Street Merchant's Association, the Neuse River Foundation, 
  the Old West Durham Neighborhood Association (and other neighborhoods like Watts-Hillandale 
  and Trinity Park), Club Boulevard Elementary, the Eno River Association and 
  others are working to establish a green space across from E.K. Powe (along Green 
  Street -- roughly between Ninth and Carolina).   Durham's elected bodies have designated this site as open space in both the Ellerbe Watershed Plan and in the Ninth Street Plan.<br>

<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">South Ellerbe Creek is 
  a tributary of the Neuse River. To help protect the stream, the entire green 
  space will remain as a natural area. The roots, branches and twigs that hang 
  over the creek, and grow in its surrounding areas, fall into the creek and provide 
  a habitat for life in the creek and farther down river. Eventually, there are 
  plans for a short nature trail and small footbridge (replacing the existing 
  footbridge) that would connect nearby residential areas with Ninth Street and 
  public transportation. Preserving the site as a natural area will help protect 
  the creek and could serve as a model for other neglected urban streams in the 
  Triangle. For this reason, the Neuse River Foundation is supporting our efforts 
  to protect this stretch of South Ellerbe. The three benefits to Durham are: 
  </font>
<ol>
  <li> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Community</b>: the 
    green space would serve as the quiet heart of a neighborhood that has lost 
    two parks to road construction. The nearby neighborhood is in transition and 
    establishing an open space in the center would help build a stronger sense 
    of community. Many organizations, far beyond the Ninth Street area, have written 
    letters of support for the open space. A natural area might also help attract 
    customers to the Ninth Street shopping district. </font></li>
  <li> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Schools</b>: generations 
    of E.K. Powe students have used the green space next door as an outdoor biology 
    classroom. Preserving this open space is an opportunity to ensure that future 
    students benefit from their lessons along the creek, adjoining wetlands and 
    other natural areas. The stretch of South Ellerbe along Green Street offers 
    a variety of flora and fauna including: wild rose bushes, blackberry bushes, 
    wild pear trees, cat tails, thrush grasses and other wetland plants, large 
    bull frogs, rabbits, and racoons. Several varieties of birds also live near 
    the green space -- including a nesting pair of red tail hawks, several other 
    hawks, male indigo buntings, rufous-sided towhees, purple finches, and several 
    types of woodpeckers.</font></li>
  <li> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Environment</b>: 
    with its 303D status, the Ellerbe Creek watershed is listed as Durham's most 
    polluted stream system. Protecting the natural areas along this section of 
    South Ellerbe Creek would reflect the Durham City Council's recent decision 
    to hold "protecting natural areas" as one of its top priorities for the year. 
    Science teachers at E.K. Powe were especially excited to see an intact wetlands 
    area just to the south of the creek -- near the school. </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Old West Durham 
          Neighborhood Association helped organize the stream cleaning group on 
          Green Street where a triumphant cheer erupted among 10 volunteers after 
          they dragged a chain-link fence out of South Ellerbe Creek. They were 
          among 50 who volunteered their time to clean a three-block stretch of 
          the creek near E.K. Powe Elementary School. Other items dragged from this 
          part of the creek included tires, bottles, cans, a computer, the fence 
          and even a French picture book dedicated to cats, "Le Chats." </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The thorough job 
        of the volunteers showed in their post-cleanup appearance. A Duke college 
        professor had twigs in his hair, and a scientist from the National Institute 
        of Environmental Health had dirt streaked from sweat running down his 
        arms. Students from Duke and local public schools assisted, along with 
        members of neighborhood and conservation groups. <br>

  Thanks to the work of many volunteers, a corner of Durham is better off today 
  than it was yesterday. On April 28, some 75 hearty souls took the plunge to 
  lend a hand and clear all sorts of debris from South Ellerbe Creek in Walltown 
  Park. Our fast-growing, very wet trash heap included everything from shopping 
  carts and television sets to water-logged carpet and an old wood wheel that 
  is now lawn art. </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Many local groups joined 
  forces to improve South Ellerbe - a three-mile creek that flows through several 
  neighborhoods in western Durham. The Walltown Community Association worked alongside 
  Urban Hiker magazine, Durham Rotary Club worked with Sierra Club, Environment 
  First worked with the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Old 
  West Durham with Self-Help, Shodor Foundation with the Durham Rescue Mission, 
  the People's Alliance with Stormwater Services, and Partners Against Crime II 
  with folks from the City Council. Durham's fish, and folks who drink water, 
  are most grateful. </font>
