        <p><font face="Bookman Old Style, Copperplate Gothic Bold, Copperplate Gothic Light, Garamond, Tahoma" size="2">A 
          horse, the property of the Andrews Furniture company doing business 
          in West Durham, had a rather unique escape from death Tuesday. The horse 
          owes his life to the presence of mind and quick work of the man driving 
          the auto that struck him. Both shoes were torn from the rear hoofs, 
          some little time being necessary to extricate the hoofs of the beast 
          from the wheel, where they were entangled. The brute suffered a few 
          bruises and scratches by being knocked down by the machine. The car 
          was a Greensboro car, driven by a Greensboro man and happened between 
          West Durham and Hickstown. <br>
          <br>
          The horse, which is a valuable one, was in charge of Mr. W. B. Andrews 
          and was being brought to the store for service. Mr. Andrews was driving 
          a team and had the unharnessed horse hitched to the rear of the wagon 
          in which he was riding. The car that struck the beast was supposedly 
          the supply car for the Greensboro man who was driving the racing Ford 
          machine. Evidently the man driver saw that machine and horse would come 
          together for with amazing quickness he threw out his clutch and applied 
          the brakes, bringing the car to a stop in time to prevent serious injury 
          to the animal. </font>
        <p><font face="Bookman Old Style, Copperplate Gothic Bold, Copperplate Gothic Light, Garamond, Tahoma" size="2">The 
          horse was knocked down by the force of the machine, his feet becoming 
          entangled in the wheels and the shoes were pulled clear from the hoofs. 
          The driver of the car acted in a decent manner for after freeing the 
          entangled horse-hoofs from his wheel he agreed to do anything to remedy 
          the mishap. The car that struck the horse was running one minute behind 
          the speeding Hudson machine driven by E. B. Lyon, winner of the race. 
          <br>
          <br>
          The horse has been in bad shape since, but after presenting him with 
          a new pair of rear feet shoes the harnessed yesterday afternoon and 
          put back in service. The company was not desirous of working him yesterday 
          but owing to their enormous trade they were forced to use him. </font>

          The residents of West Durham, especially those living on what is known 
          as Main street, are huffy at the treatment accorded them by the county 
          commissioners. They claim that the water now stands in the ditch, on 
          the east side of the street, until it stagnates causing bad odors in 
          that section. The general understanding is that the commissioners will 
          be asked in a formal manner to remedy this matter in the near future. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Some time ago the commissioners had a force of hands on this job and 
          while attempting to remedy the matter they put the ditch in worse shape 
          than before they touched it, at least this is what several of the residents 
          claim. They claim that the ditch was improperly drained and it would 
          have been better for the people living in that section if no work had 
          been done at all. </font>
        <p><font face="Bookman Old Style, Copperplate Gothic Bold, Copperplate Gothic Light, Garamond, Tahoma" size="2">The 
          management of the cotton mill in West Durham put a squad of laborers 
          on their side of the street and threw the mud out of the ditch. After 
          leaving it in the street a sufficient time to permit it to dry out they 
          carted it away with their wagons and carts. As a result the ditch on 
          the west side of the street is in good condition while the ditch on 
          the east side is in bad shape. </font>
        <p><font face="Bookman Old Style, Copperplate Gothic Bold, Copperplate Gothic Light, Garamond, Tahoma" size="2">If 
          the matter is not remedied the stagnating water will breed thousands 
          of mosquitoes when the weather warms up and it is against this pest 
          that the residents wish to be guarded. </font>

          the other team to score several runs they would come for their half 
          and bat the ball away. The Red Hill pitcher was far from invincible 
          yet he was far above his twirling opponents and was a handy man with

          first game played was between Red Hill and South side and the score 
          ended 29-8 favor of Red Hill. As each swatter would amble out to the 
          plate he would say the name of some diamond hero -- Ty Cobb, Hans (Wagerner) 
          Wagner, and Smoky Joe and with a grin he would fall on the ball for 
          a triple and very often would romp across the rubber when the pitchers 
          back was turned as he watched a man try to take a lead off first or 
          second base. The South Siders were not in the game at any stage and 
          the measly number of runs they secured were worked for. <br>
