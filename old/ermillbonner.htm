        <p><b>By Paul Bonner</b> </p>
        <p> <i><font size="2">Reproduced with permission from the <a href="http://www.herald-sun.com">Durham 
          Herald-Sun</a> (November 14, 2000).</font></i><font size="2"> </font> 
        <p><font size="2">The mill's heart beat in row upon row of machines that 
          pounded and clacked in cavernous rooms where the workers who served 
          them had to shout to be heard. Day, evening and graveyard shift, the 
          workers came and went but the heartbeat continued. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> Outside, in the village that surrounded the mill like 
          a hive, the sound reverberated and so pervaded the workers' consciousness 
          that they noticed it only when it ceased, making Sundays seem unnaturally 
          still. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> In the big house on the hill above the village, a boy 
          in a second-story bedroom was lulled to sleep by the sound. He heard 
          it as a whirring hum at night, when conversation in the house was muted 
          and the streets outside fell silent. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> The sound reassured him that while he slept, his neighbors 
          carried on the work of the village. No one could be lonely hearing it. 
          The sound spoke of the endurance of the mighty engine of prosperity 
          whose parts worked together like those of a living being. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> His mother's family had built that engine and stoked 
          it with money and ingenuity. Cotton bales would keep going in one end 
          of the complex of brick buildings and smokestacks, and sheets and pillowcases 
          would keep coming out the other, as long as cotton grew or people slept 
          in beds. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> Or so it seemed. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> The boy, Ed Watkins, is now 57. His mother, Claudia 
          Powe Watkins, 92, is the daughter of Erwin Mills' first superintendent, 
          Edgar Knox Powe, and the niece of the part-owner for whom it was named, 
          William A. Erwin. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> Ed Watkins believes anyone whose family worked in Erwin 
          Cotton Mills probably feels the same way about the sound. </font> 
        <p> <font size="2">"I still miss it," he said. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> Little remains of Erwin Cotton Mills, the factory that 
          once was synonymous with West Durham. Just the long, brick No. 1 Mill 
          building and the house that served as company headquarters, beside Ninth 
          Street on Main Street. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> Even there, few clues remain of the former life. The 
          mill buildings have become apartments and offices. Ninth Street's stores 
          that once catered to mill workers by offering staples and cheap goods 
          have been transformed mostly into trendy restaurants and boutiques. 
          A few clues to the village's habits and needs, however, can still be 
          found preserved in places like McDonald's Pharmacy, whose appearance 
          has changed little through the decades. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> And in more than a few of the simple four-room cottages 
          that Erwin Mills rented to its workers for $1 a week (comparable, non-subsidized 
          housing rented for roughly five times that amount), former mill workers 
          have lived since they bought them. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> Irene Maynor and her husband Lacy were once among those 
          residents, in a house at the corner of Rutherford Street and Hillsborough 
          Road. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> Maynor worked 42 years as a weaver, which meant that 
          she operated mechanical looms, watching as many as two dozen of the 
          machines at a time. If any of the hundreds of threads on each loom broke, 
          as often happened, she had to retie the ends with a weaver's knot. When 
          each heavy roll of cloth was complete, she had to "doff" it, or remove 
          it from the machine. Later in her career, the company assigned that 
          work to men who were known as doffers. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> Now 86, Maynor no longer lives in West Durham, but 
          in a trim apartment on Peppertree Street in northern Durham. She retired 
          from Erwin Mills 25 years ago, but when asked, can still, with a quick 
          twist of the hand, tie a weaver's knot in a piece of fine thread. </font> 
        <p> <font size="2">"You had to work fast," she said. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> <b>Cradle to grave </b></font> 
        <p><font size="2"> Maynor was paid by the "pick" -- the number of times 
          the loom's warp threads shifted and the shuttle flew across, tracked 
          by a counter at the top of the loom. Weavers accordingly tried to stay 
          on the good side of their "fixer," or mechanic, since it wouldn't pay 
          to have a malfunctioning loom. Her husband, who died in 1972, worked 
          as a fixer. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> The work was dirty, hot in the summer and noisy. Cotton 
          lint floated in the air and covered everything and everybody like fine 
          snow, especially in the spinning room. When Maynor spent any time in 
          the spinning room she was racked by coughing. Years later, some workers 
          were diagnosed with emphysema and "brown lung" disease. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> After she left work each evening, her ears still rang 
          from the noise. In the 1960s, OSHA came through and said the weavers 
          had to wear earplugs. For many workers, it was too late. </font> 
        <p> <font size="2">"A lot of the older people did lose their hearing," 
          Maynor said. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> Her parents worked there also, from the time the family 
          moved to Durham from Danville, Va., in 1933, when she was 19. She had 
          already been working in such factories since she was 13. She started 
          out "filling batteries" -- not electrical batteries but wheel-like contraptions 
          that held a number of spindles of thread, called "quills," that fed 
          the looms. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> Delores Stansbury recently found in family papers her 
          father's weekly paycheck stub from Erwin Mills, from 1941. It showed 
          his pay as 49.2 cents an hour, with deductions of 14 cents for hospitalization 
          insurance and 15 cents for group life insurance. His net pay for the 
          week was $19.22, well above the average pay of about $15. Workers could 
          also have deducted from their paychecks their rent and company-supplied 
          coal, kerosene and ice. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> In its cradle-to-grave paternal system typical of factories 
          of the time, Erwin Mills provided its workers with entertainment and 
          community events at its own auditorium -- which also served as a community 
          center -- fruit baskets at Christmas and even burial plots. The Old 
          West Durham Neighborhood Association has worked to clear out the underbrush 
          that had grown up in decades of neglect of the old Cedar Hill Cemetery. 
          A follow-up session, or "touch-up," is planned for this Saturday. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> Company housing was modest and decent by the standards 
          of the times, decidedly Spartan by those of today. The houses lacked 
          insulation or foundation skirting. They had running water but most lacked 
          bathtubs and some lacked commodes. They were heated by coal stoves and 
          had electricity, although until well after the mid-century they lacked 
          refrigerators. Most lots included a garage, and many workers owned a 
          car (although, like most other people, almost no mill worker owned more 
          than one). </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> Workers hung a card on their front porches to indicate 
          to the ice deliveryman how many pounds to put in their icebox that day. 
          No one thought of locking doors. Watkins remembers seeing on some houses 
          do-not-disturb signs advising that a third-shift worker slept there 
          during the day. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> In the evening, workers could watch movies at Erwin 
          Auditorium, which stood across Main Street from the mill. The building 
          also contained a bowling alley and served as a meeting hall for a number 
          of community organizations. The park, which featured a swimming pool, 
          was the site of company picnics, especially each July 4. Workers received 
          vacation time off, but took it all at the same time, when the factory 
          would close in the summer. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> Wayne Smith's father, Lewis Smith, worked in Erwin 
          Mills 43 years, as Smith also did briefly before going into the military. 
          Later, Wayne Smith worked 30 years in the Durham Fire Department. He 
          was stationed part of that time in the No. 2 fire station on Ninth Street. 
          </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> He remembers the light that flashed outside a factory 
          entrance on Hillsborough Road at 6 a.m. each weekday morning. Then the 
          gates would open for a short time and the shifts would change. Then 
          the gates were locked again. </font> 
        <p> <font size="2">"If you weren't in by that time, you didn't work that 
          day," Smith said. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> On summer evenings, workers and their families sat 
          on front porches. Neighbors gathered for conversation or a game of horseshoes 
          or to listen to the radio together. </font> 
        <p> <font size="2">"That was the entertainment," Smith said. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> <b>Textiles' role large </b></font> 
        <p><font size="2"> Of Durham's old-line industries, tobacco's role is 
          better known today than that of growing and processing cotton goods, 
          even if the latter was older and was developed along with tobacco. In 
          1852, Orange Factory was built to spin and weave cloth. Orange Factory 
          was so named because it was then the only factory in Orange County, 
          which included present-day Durham County, according to Jean Bradley 
          Anderson's authoritative "Durham County: A History." Where it stood 
          is now under water at the Little River reservoir in northern Durham 
          County. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> In the 1890s, after tobacco had made millionaires of 
          the Dukes, Julian Carr, George Watts and others, those magnates sought 
          to diversify their interests. They looked primarily to textiles, finance 
          and, in the Dukes' case, the new industry of electrical power. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> Brodie Duke built Pearl Cotton Mills (named for his 
          daughter). As apartments, the buildings still are in use, at the corner 
          of Duke Street and Trinity Avenue. Later, Pearl Mills became Mill No. 
          6 of Erwin Mills. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> Duke's half-brother Benjamin Duke in 1892 started Erwin 
          Mills, enlisting Erwin, a scion of the textile manufacturing Holt family 
          in Alamance County, to serve on the company's board and run the plant. 
          Erwin put in $40,000 of the $125,000 total capitalization and was promised 
          a 40 percent return on his investment. Duke added an incentive by proposing 
          that the new mill be named after Erwin. Thus, the story goes, if it 
          failed or thrived, the result would reflect on Erwin personally. Erwin 
          Mills opened in the summer of 1893. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> Previously, the area where it was built had been known 
          as Pinhook, the name of a low grade of smoking tobacco, which reflected 
          the area's rough and rowdy character. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> Like other Durham textile mills, Erwin Mills first 
          produced the small cloth pouches in which smoking tobacco was sold. 
          </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> The Dukes continued investing in textile mills beyond 
          Durham; the town of Erwin in Harnett County, where one such mill was 
          located, was originally named Duke. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> From the beginning in the Durham plant, Erwin and Powe 
          saw to their workers' needs, temporal and spiritual. They set aside 
          land for a Sunday school, the auditorium and a park with a swimming 
          pool and baseball field (now a soccer field) behind the auditorium. 
          </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> Erwin, an Episcopalian, built St. Joseph's Episcopal 
          Church on West Main Street near the plant. Powe visited with mill hands 
          on their front porches and gave them rose bush cuttings to plant in 
          their yards. Some of those roses still bloom. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> <b>Monkey business </b></font> 
        <p><font size="2"> Watkins grew up in a house on Swift Avenue, which stood 
          where that street now crosses the Durham Freeway. The E.K. Powe house 
          still stands at the corner of Swift Avenue and Pettigrew Street. The 
          Powe family sold it to the B.W. Roberts family, who lived there for 
          decades before selling it to the nursing home that now occupies the 
          former site of Erwin's home and bears its name, Hillhaven. In the 1970s, 
          the Powe house, its upkeep much neglected, was home to students for 
          whom its faded grandeur added to the hippie commune atmosphere they 
          gave it. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> During that time, the house became known as "Monkey 
          Top," as a counterpart to the neighborhood of mill houses below it to 
          the southwest called Monkey Bottom. According to one account, the latter 
          gained its name when monkeys from a traveling circus or zoo escaped 
          their cages and evaded recapture for some period. Residency in Monkey 
          Bottom carried a social stigma. Cotton mill workers as a whole were 
          sometimes pejoratively labeled, or referred to themselves, as "lint 
          dodgers" or "lint heads." </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> The Powe house and nearby Sunnyside, the home of Erwin's 
          brother Jesse Harper Erwin, have been shifted slightly on their sites 
          and have been restored for use as offices. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> For most of the century, Erwin Mills turned out sheets 
          and pillowcases, especially during the war years, when government contracts 
          ensured full employment. During the Depression, however, reduced hours 
          and temporary spot layoffs were common, as attested in a series of profiles 
          of Erwin Mills workers written in 1938 by Ida L. Moore. Families she 
          interviewed frequently mentioned being required at times to take a few 
          days' "rest" from their mill jobs. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> Not much is known about Moore except that she wrote 
          the sketches for the Folklore Project of the Federal Writers Project, 
          headed by folk musicologist John Lomax. One of several social documentary 
          series providing work for writers, photographers, sociologists and folklorists 
          during the Depression, the Erwin Mills worker profiles can be read online 
          at the Old West Durham Neighborhood Association's Web site. The neighborhood 
          association has accompanied the articles with modern photographs of 
          the houses where Moore interviewed her subjects (www.owdna.org/wpa1.htm). 
          The Web site also contains vintage photographs and a history of Erwin 
          Mills and the neighborhood. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> Those 1930s denizens of Monkey Bottom would hardly 
          recognize the place now. Moore found Mary Smith at home on Ninth Street, 
          where a Lebanese restaurant now does a brisk business. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> Smith told Moore how, at age 15, she came with her 
          family from a sharecropper's shack to Durham and she went to work in 
          the mills earning $1 for each 12-hour day's work. Like many Monkey Bottomers, 
          she supplemented her pay by taking home tobacco bags and inserting the 
          drawstrings with their paper tags. Whole families spent their evenings 
          "tagging," making a few cents per thousand bags. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> At a house on Broad Street that now houses Bull City 
          Sound, Sally Dunne, half-blind and raising seven children, told Moore 
          of her fears that her husband's drinking could get him fired from his 
          $14-a-week job. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> These profiles and others from across the United States 
          during the Depression years also can be viewed at the Web site of the 
          Library of Congress, where they are part of an online collection called 
          "American Life Histories" (memory.loc.gov/ammem/wpaintro/wpahome.html). 
          </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> <b>The heartbeat stops </b></font> 
        <p><font size="2"> In counterpoint to the mill owners' paternal attitudes, 
          labor unions demanding improved pay, hours and conditions began making 
          inroads early in the 20th century. They made little progress, however, 
          until the mid-century. Maynor remembers strikes in the 1940s. Union 
          relations with the mill's management, remained cordial, however, even 
          during two strikes in that decade. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> Maynor participated in at least one strike. She recalls 
          how strikers received vouchers for food from a commissary on Rosehill 
          Avenue. </font> 
        <p> <font size="2">"When I did go back to work, they had taken my seniority 
          away," she said. "They did a lot of them that way if they didn't go 
          back by a certain time. My husband wanted me to stay out until the end 
          of the strike." </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> Her overseer (so supervisors were called) told her 
          he would restore her seniority if she would work six weeks on the third 
          shift at the No. 1 mill. Her husband urged her to refuse, not wanting 
          her to work the overnight shift. At first, she did refuse. But then 
          she went against her husband's wishes and agreed. At the end of the 
          assignment, she got back her seniority. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> Erwin Mills merged in 1970 with Burlington Industries. 
          In 1986, Burlington sold the factory to the J.P. Stevens Co., and the 
          factory closed shortly thereafter. At nearly a century old, Erwin was 
          considered outmoded and inefficient. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> Within a few years the Durham Freeway was completed, 
          bisecting the former Erwin Park and Monkey Bottom. Most of the mill 
          buildings were demolished. On part of the site in the late 1980s the 
          Erwin Square office building was erected. </font> 
        <p> <font size="2">"I didn't think I'd ever see the mills go," Smith said. 
          "I thought they were here to stay." </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> Other Durham textile mills by that time had suffered 
          the same fate, as the economic center of gravity shifted to new industries 
          and medical centers like the Veterans Administration hospital near Erwin 
          Mills. Jobs seeped away from the central city toward Research Triangle 
          Park. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> Even if the mills had remained, Maynor wouldn't have 
          wanted her two daughters to work there. Her eldest daughter trained 
          as a secretary and worked at the VA Hospital. The younger daughter worked 
          at Liggett & Myers. They both received better pay and benefits than 
          she did continuing working at Erwin Mills. She retired in 1975. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> Nowadays, the conditions and pay she and other workers 
          accepted would seem to most people harsh, Maynor said. At the time, 
          most mill workers knew only others like themselves. Most saw few prospects 
          for climbing the socioeconomic ladder. But, like the Maynors, they sought 
          to improve their children's opportunities. </font> 
        <p> <font size="2">"They were good days, but I wouldn't want to go back 
          that way," Maynor said.</font><font size="2"> </font>
