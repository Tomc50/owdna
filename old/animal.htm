        <p align="left"><b>Rabies</b></p>
        <p align="left">Animal Control is responsible for the control of domestic 
          animals. The department answers all questions and complaints concerning 
          animals and assures that pets are properly licensed and vaccinated. 
          On a daily basis, Animal Control Officers respond to a variety of animal 
          related calls. Some of these calls include: animal bites, animal cruelty 
          investigations reports of dangerous animals, injured or sick animals, 
          animals at large and nuisance animal complaints. </p>
        <p align="left">With the recent influx of rabies related incidents, officers 
          are especially attentive to reports of abnormal behavior in wildlife. 
          Animals that are picked up by offices are housed and cared for by the 
          Animal Protection Society at 2117 E. Club Blvd (560-0640, office hours: 
          M-F, 9 AM-5 PM, Sat., 9 AM-Noon); This office also ensures public compliance 
          of the County Animal Control Ordinance and state statutes. </p>
        <h4 align="left">Gee Officer, I didn't know that!" </h4>
        <p align="left">Here are some common violations you may or may not be 
          aware of. </p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>1. All animals must be restrained on a person's own property or on 
            a leash when off their property. </p>
          <p>2. All dogs and cats must be vaccinated for rabies and their rabies 
            tag displayed at all times. </p>
          <p>3. All dogs and cats must be licensed. </p>
          <p>4. All animals must have food at least once a day, a constant supply 
            and clean water and shelter from the elements at all times (i.e. dog 
            house). </p>
          <p>5. A female dog in heat must be kept in a building or secure enclosure.</p>
          <p>6. A dog can be deemed a public nuisance if it is allowed to bark 
            at night (11pm-7am) or for a 10 minute period during the day (one 
            or more barks per minute). </p>
          <p>7. Cats can be deemed a public nuisance when it: is found on the 
            property of another, walks on or sleeps on the automobiles of another, 
            damages gardens or other foliage or other real or personal popety, 
            is allowed by the owner to habitually roam or be found on the property 
            of another. </p>
          <p>8. A dog cannot be housed or restrained within 15 feet of a public 
            right-of-way. </p>
          <p>9. All dogs or cats that bite humans must be quarantined for a 10-day 
            period at the animal shelter or veterinarian. </p>
          <p>10. All animals bites must be reported to Animal Control. </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p align="left">These are just some of the many violations that Animal 
          Control Officers encounter on a daily basis. Each violation can result 
          in a possible impoundment of the animal, a civil penalty of least $25.00 
          or more and/or criminal action taken against the owner, if you have 
          any questions about the Durham County Animal Control Ordinance or animal 
          related state statutes, contact the Animal Control Department. </p>
        <h4 align="left">Be Responsible... Spay or Neuter your cats and dogs.        </h4>
        <p align="left">"Spaying and "neutering" are words you're probably familiar 
          with. What you may not know is that these procedures are the most essential 
          part of being a responsible pet owner. </p>
        <p align="left">Every year, millions of unwanted and homeless cats and 
          dogs us put to sleep by pounds and animal shelters. The overpopulation 
          of dogs and cats can only be corrected if pet owners realize their important 
          role. These surgical procedures are relatively safe and painless and 
          will prolong and enhance the life of your pet. A spayed or neutered 
          pet is less troublesome and more relaxed. A neutered male is less aggressive, 
          thus reducing fighting and possible injury. </p>
        <p align="left">Spaying or neutering also reduces the likelihood of your 
          pet developing cancer or infection of the prostate gland in males and 
          mammary tumors in females. An added benefit in Durham County is a reduced 
          license fee for spayed and neutered pets. </p>
        <h4 align="left">Rabies in Durham: Some facts you need to know </h4>
        <p align="left">What is rabies? Rabies is a viral disease that affects 
          the nervous system of mammals. In the last stages of the disease, the 
          virus moves from the brain into the salivary glands and saliva. From 
          there the virus can be transmitted through a bite or by contact with 
          mucous membranes (nose, mouth and eyes). The incubation period for the 
          disease is variable, between 2 weeks and 6 months. Some symptoms include: 
          nocturnal animals seen out during the day, animals that are not afraid 
          of humans, aggressive animals that attack other animals or people without 
          provocation, paralysis of the limbs or throat. Rables is almost always 
          fatal once symptoms occur. </p>
        <p align="left">Who can get rabies? Any mammal can get rabies, including 
          humans, dogs, cats, cows, and horses. In North America, raccoons, bats, 
          skunks, foxes and coyotes are most commonly diagnosed with rabies. </p>
        <p align="left">How do I protect my animals and myself? The best protection 
          against rabies is vaccination and and avoidance of risk. Vaccination 
          of dogs and cats is required by law. If your dog or cat fights with 
          a raccoon or suspect animal, notify Animal Control, have your animal 
          boostered for rabies within 72 hours and do not touch or go near the 
          wild animal. Do not feed or attract wildlife onto your property, thus 
          avoiding possible contact. </p>
