        just one mile from the city in a westerly direction nestles the village 
        designated as West Durham. Chiefly composed of a cotton mill element the 
        village presents a great contrast to villages of the same nature, in the 
        fact that it has broken away from the primeval custom of similar towns. 
        One noticeable feature about the above mentioned village is it’s thrifty 
        appearance and clean fresh look. In speaking of a cotton mill village 
        one usually imagines the place to be composed of a rowdy element that 
        furnishes a lot of trouble for the surrounding country, and this is usually 
        the case, but does not hold good in West Durham district. So well behaved 
        is this element that only one officer is needed to keep order. Deputy 
        Joe Pleasants has very little to do and whenever he is called on to restore 
        quiet and order the offender or offenders are usually one or many that 
        have become residents of the hamlet from some other mill town, where such 
        disorder is the chief custom.</font>

          <b>IS GROWING RAPIDLY.</b></font> 
        <p><font face="Bookman Old Style, Copperplate Gothic Bold, Copperplate Gothic Light, Garamond, Tahoma" size="2"> 
          West Durham has stepped forward rapidly in the past three years and 
          her growth has been wonderful. The placing of such institutions as the 
          Watts hospital in the neighborhood has tended to increase the growth 
          of the hamlet and to advance the worth of property to a great extent 
          and cause people to build in that neighborhood. Usually the building 
          of a settlement of this kind is for renting purposes but this is not 
          true in this case. The people are building for residential purposes 
          and those who have moved into the neighborhood are more than pleased 
          with the section. The extension of the car line to the hospital and 
          a continuation of this line to the Country Club has raised the price 
          of real estate and made suburban property very valuable. The strip of 
          land that lies between the hospital and the Country Club, formerly owned 
          by Mr. Jones, has been purchased by real estate dealers, cut up into 
          building lots and easily disposed of for the value of such property 
          is recognized by the far sighted. Preparations for the cutting op of 
          the Warren farm, just beyond West Durham, are under way and this will 
          be followed by a rush to buy the moment the sale is announced.</font>

          Situated south of the railroad, in the more aristocratic district of 
          the village, stands a frame structure used for educational purposes. 
          This building has served well for a number of years but now it is inadequate 
          and its use will be discontinued with this years closing. A brick building 
          is under construction, located on what is known as the Warren row, and 
          will be completed in time for the spring term of 1913. The building 
          is made of brick and is a three story structure, counting the basement, 
          which will be utilized to excellent advantage. The roof is made of the 
          most substantial galvanized iron and the building will stand the wear 
          of years. The equipment will include city water and electrical installments, 
          making the shoal house in perfect keeping with similar institutions 
          in the city. The outer walls are completed, the roof of the building 
          is now on, the flooring has been laid, the lathing completed, the window 
          sash, composed of one glass are in, and a portion of the plastering 
          in the upper story has been finished. The doors are on the premises 
          and ready to be hinged to the already set frames. The most beautiful 
          feature is that the building is located less than five minutes walk 
          from the heart of the mill district and it is from this district that 
          the greatest number of pupils come. Able instructors will be in charge 
          and the children of the mill-man will receive the same advantages as 
          the children of the most aristocratic families in the most up-to-date 
          neighborhoods, being handicapped by no more disadvantages than the children 
          that attend school in the largest cities, under the most modern conditions, 
          and perhaps not as many.</font>

          The village of West Durham is supplied with all the modern conditions 
          that attend a down town district. Shoppers receive the same careful 
          attention that is given patrons of department stores. The town is supplied 
          with stores that carry in stock everything to wear and to be used in 
          the home. Representatives from the dry goods and millinery stores visit 
          the northern markets and are as discerning in the wares they purchase 
          for the home trade as the most fastidious could want. After the visit 
          to the northern markets are made the stores advertise and receive a 
          patronage that is envied by the down town district. The residents of 
          the village are less handicapped than city shoppers inasmuch as they 
          have less distance to walk, many living within haling distance of the 
          stores.</font>

        <p><font face="Bookman Old Style, Copperplate Gothic Bold, Copperplate Gothic Light, Garamond, Tahoma" size="2"> 
          It is well worth a trip to this village for a sight-seer On a trip of 
          this kind one would see clean, well swept yards, tidy houses, built 
          and painted differently, which is in direct contrast to the usual mill 
          settlement, fenced in enclosures with excellent stocks of poultry, thriving 
          gardens and a home-like air that is very restful, especially to the 
          mill-man or woman after a day’s toil in the factory. The yards to the 
          mill houses, that back of the public roads, are fenced in by a five 
          foot board fence which gives excellent protection against passerby.</font>

          West Durham Presbyterian chapel has been in harmony with the remainder 
          of the churches, both in the city and suburbs. Rev. A. W. Crawford, 
          a visiting minister, has been assisting in the services during the past 
          week, and delivering sermons of unusual power. Many conversions have 
          been made and still others are looked for before the close of the series. 
          Everyone is extended a cordial invitation to attend the services and

          The West Durham Methodists are located in admirable quarters and are 
          in condition to conduct worshipful services in a commendable manner. 
          Rev. A. J. Parker, pastor of the church, is a man of deep learning and 
          great experience and is looked to explicitly by his congregation. Services 
          are held in this church with the same regularity as they were elsewhere 
          and the attendance and attention is always good. During the past week 
          this church, together with many others, have been conducting a union

          has made rapid strides forward since it’s organization and is now one 
          of the strong factors of the recent evangelistic meeting and church.

          The Episcopal church, pastored over by Rev. Thomas L. Trott, is another 
          feature in West Durham life that is commendable. Their edifice is one 
          of the prettiest, neatest little churches in the community and her manner. 
          The attendance is always as in the other churches the word of God is 
          preached, in an understandable good, considering the number of Episcopalians
