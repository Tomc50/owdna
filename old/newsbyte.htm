        <BR>

        <P>
        <P>As part of your neighborhood association's efforts to improve the quality 
          of life in Old West Durham, we have identified speeding cars on Oakland 
          Avenue and Knox Street as one of our neighborhood's biggest traffic 
          problems. As the only straight shot through the heart of Old West Durham, 
          Oakland is the preferred route for cut-through traffic. Commuters, late-night 
          weekend drivers and others are speeding through the neighborhood on 
          Oakland -- some hitting their brakes at the top of the hill to slow 
          down for the stop sign at Englewood Avenue. 
        <P>
        <P> We are working with the City of Durham to improve the situation. At 
          our request, the City recently conducted traffic counts on Oakland confirming 
          that 86% of vehicles traveling on the 25 mph street travel an average 
          speed of 31 mph or faster. And, that more than 700 vehicles use Oakland 
          on a given day. 
        <P>
        <P> With the experience of other Durham neighborhoods in mind, the board 
          of the Old West Durham Neighborhood Association is opposed to the use 
          of speed humps. Other towns have used traffic circles to slow down cut-through 
          traffic. A traffic circle also allows motorists to see that they are 
          traveling in a neighborhood with children and pedestrians -- and that 
          we are not just an easy short cut for getting from point A to point 
          B faster (according to the City, the traffic circle would have low-lying 
          shrubs and be big enough to slow down traffic without displacing the 
          existing curbs at the intersection). 
        <P>
        <P> We've met the "preliminary criteria" and now need to get signatures 
          on a petition for the City of Durham. We have four teams collecting 
          the signatures of homeowners living one block in each direction of the 
          Oakland/Knox intersection. The response has been great. 
        <P>
        <P> In our efforts to build a stronger community, your neighborhood association 
          recently got 75 new street lights for Old West Durham, put up a new 
          neighborhood sign at Ninth and Hillsborough, developed a website, received 
          an Indy Citizen's Award and a proclamation from Mayor Nick Tennyson, 
          and have built bridges with Ninth Street Merchants, Duke University, 
          Partners Against Crime, Durham Police and others. We are also working 
          on establishing a neighborhood park and are getting ready for the eventual 
          development of Erwin Square.

        <FONT SIZE=2> 
        <P>
        <P>The Green Street "green space" between 9th and Virgie was spruced up 
          by 14 OWD neighbors. They came and filled 4 pickup trucks worth of debris. 
          The refuse was hauled away by the city's Impact Team, which also provided 
          the pickers, bags and yard tools to help with the clean up. District 
          2 city-wide clean up is on March 27 and you can take any large items, 
          paint cans and the like to Durham County Stadium.

        at Site of Former Mill</B></FONT> <BR>
        <FONT SIZE=2> <FONT COLOR=black> 
        <P>Nestled in the woods between EK Powe Elementary school and Hillsborough 
          Road is a large &quot;dye pond&quot; surrounded by a screened fence. 
          The dye pond is left over from the Erwin textile mill -- when run-off 
          from the mill operations used to flow away from the mill (apparently, 
          in the past, the neighborhood often smelled like a big laundry mat from 
          the warm water that flowed out of the mills). 
        <P>We don't know if the dye pond presents a health hazard. Its placement 
          next to an elementary school and near many homes should be a concern. 
          Potential health risks associated with the dye pond include possible 
          chemical residues in the water or leaching into the surrounding soil 
          and creek bed. If nothing else (non-toxic dyes do exist), it seems to 
          be a huge breeding place for mosquitoes.
