        </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">From the black 
          and white photographs that adorn its walls and tell its story down to 
          its old-time soda fountain at the front counter, McDonald's Drug Store 
          on Durham's Ninth Street has a history as rich as the homemade milkshakes 
          for which it is legendary. It's a history that was born some 83 years 
          ago when Angus McDonald first opened the doors to the pharmacy on East 
          Main Street. And it's a history that lives proudly today in owner John 
          McDonald, Angus' son, who has devoted himself to managing the drugstore 
          for the better part of his 76 years. <br>
          </font> </p>
        <table width="600" border="0">
          <tr> 
            <td width="220" height="302"> 
              <p><font color="Navy" size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><img src="graphics/history/JohnMcDonald2.jpg" width="227" height="300"><br>
                </font><font color="Navy" size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">John 
                McDonald.</font></p>
            </td>
            <td width="200" height="302"> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">For nine 
                decades, McDonald's-nestled on the Ninth Street strip since 1916-has 
                witnessed a metamorphosis of downtown Durham from its industrial 
                beginnings when, John McDonald recalls, "cotton mills and tobacco 
                factories were about all there was." </font> </p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The more 
                the face and the composition of businesses around it changed, 
                the more McDonald's remained the same; that, in fact, is the unwritten 
                prescription for the pharmacy's endurance and appeal. </font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I just sort 
                of figured that if this thing survived the Depression and two 
                [world] wars, then I'd better keep it as it is," McDonald says, 
                laughing warmly.</font> 
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">But even McDonald 
          knows that the pharmacy, and the nostalgia it elicits, are not forever-especially 
          in a corporate world that favors profit over personality. And so, just 
          as McDonald's has witnessed history and possesses a great deal of its 
          own, it may very well soon become part of it. </font> </p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"It's the last 
          of an era-this type of 1914 drugstore is going into the record books," 
          McDonald says. "These stores are shrinking daily. This is about the 
          last one." </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Growing up with 
          the drugstore </b></font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">John McDonald was 
          born in 1920 on Broad Street; he has, in the most literal sense, grown 
          up with the drugstore. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><img src="graphics/history/JohnMcDonald4.jpg" width="384" height="302"></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="Navy">McDonald 
          family homestead on Broad Street.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">After graduating 
          high school in 1938, he worked in the Erwin Cotton Mill-now the site 
          of Erwin Square Apartments-for a year and a half, earning $11.88 a week. 
          It was the height of the Depression, a time when living and working 
          conditions were bearable at best, and utterly destitute at worst. </font> 
        </p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"People just couldn't 
          make it," McDonald remembers. "Some people were actually not eating; 
          there was just no work to be found." </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Those years of 
          struggle, along with his father's compassion during them, left an indelible 
          impression on the younger McDonald. To hear him recall his memories 
          of the era in such vivid detail is to understand why the store means 
          so much to him, why he is so proud that it bears his family name. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"My father served 
          the community in hard times during the Depression," McDonald explains. 
          "I know he'd fill prescriptions when people just didn't have the money 
          to pay. He felt an obligation and he fulfilled that. He was a service 
          to the community in a time of need." </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">And so when McDonald 
          faced two career paths-milling cotton or mixing prescriptions with his 
          father-his decision was little more than an afterthought. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I was not on fire 
          to follow in the pharmacy, especially during the Depression," he says. 
          "But I had been in and around the store all my life. After working at 
          the mill, I decided pharmacy would probably be the better choice." </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">His decision led 
          him in 1939 to pharmacy school at the University of North Carolina at 
          Chapel Hill, the only one of its kind in the state at the time. But 
          World War II would temporarily put his pharmaceutical plans on hold. 
          McDonald volunteered for the American military effort and enrolled at 
          the U.S. Navy Pre-Flight School in Chapel Hill, where he lived on the 
          same hall with the youngest trainee of the lot-a fellow named George 
          Bush, with whom he was friendly but "not buddy-buddy." (On the back 
          wall of the pharmacy hangs a signed photograph, given by a mutual friend, 
          of the former president, offering McDonald his best wishes.) </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Although McDonald 
          never left the country or saw combat, he served as a flight instructor 
          for the duration of the war. On the day he was released from active 
          duty, the final day of 1945, he married his wife, Frances. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"New Year's Eve, 
          it's easy to remember that," McDonald chuckles. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">McDonald was glad 
          to be home. The four years he spent in the Navy were the longest he 
          would ever be away from the drugstore in his entire life. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Entering the 
          family tradition </b></font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">After his military 
          service ended, McDonald returned home to finish pharmacy school and 
          finally received his pharmacy license in 1949, 10 years after he first 
          entered the school. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I've been at it 
          ever since," he says modestly. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Upon graduation, 
          he joined his father in the drugstore, where the two worked side by 
          side for 25 years until Angus' death in 1973 at age 88. In a fitting 
          tribute, the pharmacy licenses of father-earned in 1905-and son hang 
          together on the back wall. So too does a laminated sheet of old McDonald's 
          prescription labels, as well as black-and-white photographs of a young 
          Angus posing in front of the pharmacy during its fledgling years, when 
          Durham's roads were still little more than dirt paths. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> John McDonald 
          is never too far removed from the drugstore's history; indeed, the tradition 
          is the lifeblood that continues to flow through the store today. Together, 
          John and Frances McDonald have run the store every day for the past 
          24 years, since his father's death. It's a family business and, for 
          Frances Sanford, a friend of the McDonalds for 25 years, the drugstore 
          feels more like a family than a business. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"They're just a 
          lovely couple," she says. "It's just like walking into your own home." 
          </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">And for McDonald, 
          it is home. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I enjoy the community 
          and the contact with the people," he says. "I probably knew 90 percent 
          of the customers, the families, and watched them grow up. Now we get 
          a lot of people in just to look and reminisce." </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> More than that, 
          sizable crowds-by word of mouth-descend upon the drugstore topped by 
          the beige-and-green-striped canopy to indulge in the homemade milkshakes 
          that John and Frances serve up with ice cream, amiable conversation 
          and smiles. Word of mouth even reached the Fodor's southern travel guide, 
          which touts McDonald's as having "the best milkshakes in town." The 
          secret, McDonald reveals, lies more in the careful preparation than 
          in the ingredients themselves. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"We do enjoy our 
          reputation [for our milkshakes]," he says. "We do a first-class product. 
          We do it the same way we've done it over the years; we don't cut corners." 
          He pauses, then grins. "When you say McDonald's, people think of fast 
          food milkshakes-we were McDonald's long before Ray Kroc cooked his first 
          hamburger." </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">But with each new 
          day and each milkshake, the unwelcome yet unavoidable question seems 
          to arise: How much longer will McDonald's pharmacy remain in business? 
          </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Remaining 'close 
          to the community' </b></font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">John McDonald doesn't 
          much care to think about crossing that bridge, although he knows it 
          awaits somewhere on the horizon. McDonald has two children (and five 
          grandchildren), neither of whom plan to take over the store when he 
          decides to hang up his pharmacist's jacket. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"It's kind of a 
          play-it-by-ear situation," he explains. "Frances and I enjoy working. 
          We don't have any plans. The first thing you do when you reach a certain 
          age is wake up and make sure you're still there-then you plan your day." 
          </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">John and Frances, 
          75, operate the pharmacy six days a week and continue to work the counter. 
          Although they stock over-the-counter drugs, the prescription pharmacy 
          portion in the rear of the drugstore has been closed since John underwent 
          an operation last November. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Sanford, who visits 
          the store each day to lunch with Frances McDonald, has known McDonald's 
          in Durham for as long as she can remember. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"They can really 
          make some milkshakes," Sanford says. "I don't think it would be a Ninth 
          Street without that drugstore-it just wouldn't be right." </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Indeed, 83 years 
          of history cannot simply disappear unnoticed. </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">For now, John McDonald 
          looks to the days ahead for the pharmacy, all the while appreciative 
          of its deeply rooted history. And for McDonald to continue doing what 
          has been essentially his life's work, well, he could want nothing more. 
          </font> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I've been close 
          to this community all these years," he says. "Just to be on the street 
          where I've been since I was a kid is enough." </font>
