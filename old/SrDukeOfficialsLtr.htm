        <!-- TemplateBeginEditable name="Text-Photos" --><p>Dear Executive Vice-President Trask,</p>
        <p>In a recent series of emails, you outlined to the Duke<br>
          community some of the measures that Duke is taking in<br>
          response to the recent robbery in the Bryan Center,<br>
          the third robbery on campus since the beginning of<br>
          November. </p>
        <p>We, the undersigned, have some concerns with those<br>
          measures, and with the ideas behind them, about how<br>
          best to ensure the security and safety of our<br>
          community. We recognize that the measures described<br>
          in these memos are not entirely new, but are part of a<br>
          longer-term process of security arrangements;<br>
          nonetheless, this seems like a particularly opportune<br>
          moment for intervention.</p>
        <p>Our major shared concern is the way that the<br>
          administration appears to have decided that the best<br>
          way to achieve safety and security for our community<br>
          is to close it off from what surrounds it, to exclude<br>
          those external to our community from access to it. <br>
          Like the thinking that governs the increasing<br>
          popularity of &lsquo;gated communities,&rsquo; this is premised on<br>
          the belief that exclusion rather than inclusion,<br>
          closed borders rather than open borders, segregation<br>
          rather than conversation, is the best way to ensure<br>
          safety and security. </p>
        <p>It seems to us that this must remain at the very least<br>
          an open question: many observers of the global<br>
          situation, outside of the mainstream US media, are<br>
          insisting that opening our communities rather than<br>
          closing them off is the better long-term method for<br>
          achieving security.</p>
        <p>We are also concerned about the collapse, in your<br>
          letters, between the importance of feeling safe, and<br>
          the importance of material safety. Both, obviously,<br>
          are important, and certainly it is a welcome<br>
          development to hear that the administration is making<br>
          it a &ldquo;high priority&rdquo; to improve lighting in areas such<br>
          as the Blue Zone. </p>
        <p>Feeling safe on campus is an important part of<br>
          belonging to the campus community; but making people<br>
          feel safer without making them actually safer is to<br>
          follow the logic of SUV salespeople, who insist that<br>
          they are doing a service to society because people<br>
        &ldquo;feel&rdquo; safer driving an SUV, despite statistics that<br>
          show SUVs are less safe than cars. The analogy might<br>
          seem awkward: the point we want to insist on is that<br>
          the majority of rapes, as well as petty-theft crimes<br>
          on campus, are committed not by those outside of the<br>
          Duke community, but by those within it. Closing down<br>
          campus to those outsiders makes us feel safer without<br>
          doing much to increase our actual safety: worse, the<br>
          rhetoric used to describe these acts of exclusion as<br>
        &lsquo;increasing safety&rsquo; creates a culture of fear that<br>
          feeds, and panders to, the desire to exclude. </p>
        <p>It seems possible that there may also be a causal<br>
          relationship between the closed-down nature of Duke<br>
          campus and the student experience of undergraduate<br>
          life on-campus as homogenous and boring, which would<br>
          suggest more positive reasons for opening up campus,<br>
          rather than closing it down.</p>
        <p>The encouragement that people report &ldquo;suspicious<br>
          behavior or individuals,&rdquo; especially following a<br>
          description of the suspect in the Bryan Center robbery<br>
          incident as &ldquo;an African American male about 5'10&quot; in<br>
          his early 20s, with a thin to medium build,&rdquo; seems to<br>
          encourage racial profiling. While, as stated above,<br>
          it is important to address people&rsquo;s feelings of<br>
          safety, it seems important to do so in ways that are<br>
          democratic, and the racial profiling that seems the<br>
          inevitable result of encouraging people to report<br>
        &ldquo;suspicious behavior or individuals&rdquo; is certainly not<br>
          a democratic response. There are already serious<br>
          discrepancies between the experiences of Duke that<br>
          undergraduates have, and the experiences of Duke that<br>
          university staff have; this kind of encouragement is<br>
          only going to make such discrepancies worse, rather<br>
          than better.</p>
        <p>The university has many excellent projects for<br>
          creating dialogue and exchange between the campus<br>
          community and the surrounding communities. It would<br>
          be a shame to allow this rhetoric of exclusion to<br>
          contradict or take away from the good work those<br>
          projects are doing. We hope you take our concerns to<br>
          heart as ways to allow that good work to continue.</p>
        <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
        <p>Simon Hay (doctoral candidate, English) along with<br>
          more than 60 professors, grad and undergrad students,<br>
          and staff at Duke. </p>
