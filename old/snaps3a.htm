          </font><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Dan and Mack 
          Moore grew up on Hale Street (photo taken in 1937). </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><img src="graphics/tour/DM914Hale47.jpg" width="406" height="278"><br>
          When he was 12 years old, Dan received the best Christmas present of 
          all -- a goat named Bill to pull his wagon. Bill took Dan anywhere in 
          West Durham that he wanted to go. Bill knew the way to Shorty Barnes 
          Supply Co. on Ninth Street for goat food. When the wagon was loaded 
          with his pellets, Bill would run all the way home. Dan knew to feed 
          him some pellets when he got home, or he'd have a very mad goat.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Behind the wagon, 
          you can barely see the Moore's shower house that Dan's father made out 
          of pine slabs. Everybody in the neighborhood knew about the shower house 
          and many people came up to 914 Hale to get a cool shower on hot summer 
          days. Fun was had by all. (1947)</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><img src="graphics/tour/DMKnx&amp;Ala48.jpg" width="317" height="480"><br>
          The picture of Dan with his goat was taken in his grandmother's yard 
          at the corner of Alabama and Knox, near the corner store that still 
          stands there today. (1948)</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><img src="graphics/tour/DM914Hale43.jpg" width="312" height="480"><br>
        </font><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the middle of 
          the summer of '43, an uncle serving in the Air Force during WWII wrote 
          home asking what the boys received for Christmas. Dan's mother insisted 
          the brothers put on their heavy winter clothes for a picture to mail 
          their uncle. With temps over 100 degrees, the boys were perspiring like 
          mad while their mother was sitting on the porch saying, "Smile." We 
        understand the smiles were not happy ones. (1943)</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><img src="graphics/tour/DM914Hale55.jpg" width="384" height="392"><br>
        </font><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">914 Hale Street 
          in 1955. Both parents worked at Erwin Mills -- Mr. Moore was an Assistant 
          Overseer in No. 1 Weave Room and Mrs. Moore was a weaver in No. 4 Weave 
          Room. Photo was taken by Dan's new wife, Lucy Moore. Home for a visit, 
          the newlyweds had car trouble and borrowed a Desoto from an uncle who 
        worked at Elkins Motor Co.</font></p>
