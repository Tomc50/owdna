		<p><strong>Groups  ask to delay vote on Duke's rezoning</strong> <br />
	    Herald-Sun, 10 July 2006&nbsp; </p>
		<p>Neighborhood  groups will ask the Durham Planning Commission to postpone an upcoming advisory  vote on Duke University's Central Campus rezoning by  a month so they can figure out what officials should ask of the school. </p>
		<p>Such  a delay &quot;shouldn't cause too much heartburn&quot; among Duke officials  since it &quot;says right on the development plan&quot; that Duke has no  immediate intention of building anything, said John Schelp,  president of the Old West Durham  Neighborhood Association. </p>
		<p>Schelp  added that he and other activists were concerned because they were  &quot;surprised to see how little of what&quot; they've discussed with the  university in recent months made it onto the largely-blank development plan  Duke filed in support of its rezoning request. </p>
		<p>Duke  officials want the City Council to apply Durham's  &quot;university and college&quot; zoning rules to the 128-acre property,  replacing the residential zoning that now covers it. A favorable council vote  would simplify the review process Duke has to  navigate before getting permission from regulators to start erecting new  buildings there. </p>
		<p>The  university's still-evolving plans for Central Campus call for a first-phase  redevelopment of the site that would contain less than 1 million square feet of  floor space. The school's executive vice president, Tallman Trask,  has said campus leaders would like to break ground in about a year. </p>
		<p>Schelp  said the coalition of neighborhood groups and merchants who've been monitoring  Duke's planning process remained interested in making sure there were limits on  campus retail development. It may ask city officials to impose square-footage  limits to ensure that whatever Duke builds isn't big  enough to compete with existing businesses, like those on Ninth Street. </p>
		<p>It  also may request some sort of building-height limit that would tighten from  west to east across the project site, which stretches along Erwin Road and the Durham Freeway from Trent Drive to Campus Drive,  Schelp said. </p>
		<p>Another  concern is the fate of three creek valleys on the site. &quot;We want to make  sure those are protected,&quot; Schelp said. </p>
		<p>Schelp  added that neighbors were pleased that Duke seemed  to be backing away from the possibility of asking a major retailer like Barnes  &amp; Noble or Borders to run a campus bookstore on the site, but would  &quot;like to see it in writing.&quot; </p>
		<p>Asked  about the bookstore recently, Trask said a full-blown Borders or Barnes &amp;  Noble &quot;isn't going to happen&quot; on Central Campus, and added that even  if Duke invited one of the mega-retailers to manage  a smaller-scale operation there, &quot;it wouldn't be branded as such.&quot; </p>
		<p>Administrators  are now &quot;leaning toward selling things&quot; at a Central Campus bookstore  that people might come to existing university stores to buy, like Duke  souvenirs and paraphernalia. They are also interested in placing it in an  accessible location, Trask said. </p>
		<p>Duke's  submission of a largely-blank development plan -- it showed only the 150-foot  transition buffers that Duke has to establish at the edges of its property, a  couple of stream buffers, three wetlands and five of the many buildings that  now stand on the 128 acres -- didn't surprise Schelp all that much. </p>
		<p>&quot;Nothing  surprises me with Duke,&quot; he said. &quot;This happens a lot. Duke  has all these committee meetings where they tell us what they're going to do,  take questions, and say, 'We'll get back to you.' That's not a conversation  with partners. That's a lecture in the classroom with teacher and student. But  we recognize that Duke does it its way, and we move  forward.&quot; </p>
		<p>Durham's  unified development ordinance, however, says a development plan must include a  &quot;schematic layout of the proposed development, showing the general  locations of various uses, building envelopes, maximum building heights,  parking and service areas, access points and circulation routes, and open space  and recreation areas.&quot; </p>
		<p>Planning  Commission members routinely criticize zoning applications that lack a detailed  development plan, but their votes and advice are not binding on elected  officials. </p>
		<p>The  commission is scheduled to consider the Central Campus rezoning during a  meeting that will begin at 6:00 p.m. Tuesday in the City Council's meeting  chamber on the first floor of City Hall. </p>

		<p><strong>Delay  proposed on Duke rezoning</strong><br /> 
	    News &amp; Observer, 11 July 2006</p>
		<p>Neighborhood  advocates hope to slow a proposed rezoning of 128 acres of Duke University  property.</p>
		<p>John Schelp and Tom Miller,  neighborhood representatives, sent a letter Monday to the Durham Planning  Commission asking the advisory board to delay consideration of Duke's  application to change the zoning for Central Campus.</p>
		<p>Duke plans to transform the land between the Gothic-style West  Campus and Georgian-style East Campus into a mix of new student housing,  academic buildings and retail stores.</p>
		<p>The  university hopes to persuade city and county officials to put the property  under the rules of the university and college zoning rules rather than the  residential zoning regulations that govern its use now.</p>
		<p>Over  the past two and a half years, neighborhood advocates and merchants have raised  concerns about new campus retail that could pull customers away from homegrown Ninth Street  businesses.</p>
		<p>They  also have pushed Duke to protect environmentally sensitive streambed hollows.</p>
		<p>The  planning commission is set to meet at [6:00] p.m. today in the City Council's  meeting chamber on the first floor of City Hall.</p>
		<p>In  their letter, neighborhood advocates said they want to see maps and notes  designate more natural areas and open space.</p>
		<p>They  also want rules that would protect the location and appearance of the historic  homes in the proposed district. And they want the plan to include limits on  parking as well as the size and location of all stores, restaurants and  entertainment planned for the new campus.</p>

		<p><strong>Planning  Commission Delays Hearing On Duke Rezoning Plan</strong> <br />
	    (WRAL, 11 July 2006)</p>
		<p>Duke will have to wait at least one more month to see if it can  revamp Central Campus. They want to turn it into a place where students can  live, shop and eat, but some nearby businesses don't like the idea.</p>
		<p>Before  Duke can do anything, the land needs to be re-zoned  from mostly residential to University District Zoning. The Durham Planning  Commission was set to hold a public hearing on the issue Tuesday night, but  concerned neighbors asked that it be delayed.</p>
		<p>Residents,  along with businesses, are worried about what exactly this development will  entail.</p>
		<p>Ninth Street restaurant owner Hamad Ghanayem  is watching Duke's plans to turn the mostly residential Central Campus into a  residential, retail and restaurant development.</p>
		<p>&quot;I  believe it's going to impact Ninth    Street business, said Ghanayem. &quot;(If) people  have more choices, they are going to have an impact.&quot;</p>
		<p>The  Regulator Bookstore was worried about competition, also.</p>
		<p>&quot;That  was a big concern to me,&quot; said co-owner Tom Campbell.  &quot;They were going to open a bookstore a quarter of a mile from here.&quot;</p>
		<p>Now,  Campbell  said Duke administrators have told him a bookstore is no longer part of the  plan.</p>
		<p>Duke has said it has a vested interest in the economic health of Durham and doesn't want  the project to negatively impact places like Ninth Street. Still, nothing has been  decided. It's that plan, or lack thereof, that has the nearby neighborhoods  concerned.</p>
		<p>&quot;Duke needs to provide a much more detailed plan,&quot; said John Schelp  of the Old West Durham  Neighborhood Association. &quot;What they've submitted is mostly blank.&quot;</p>
		<p>Concerned  neighbors are hoping the planning commission's move to delay a decision on  re-zoning for the project will give them and the businesses time to get more details.</p>
		<p>&quot;This  puts the ball in Duke's court,&quot; said Schelp. &quot;We know they know what  the issues are. We know we can talk with them because we've worked with them in  the past.&quot;</p>
		<p>[Caution:  now entering spin zone...] To show its commitment to Ninth Street businesses, Duke  announced a pilot program last week that will give all first-year students $50  to spend at certain restaurants on Ninth    Street. [Duke can show  its commitment to Ninth Street  and other local businesses by expand its DukeCard to be used off campus as we  asked... these $50 certificates are a nice PR stunt designed to get good  publicity.]</p>
		<p>Duke's  revitalization of Central Campus is expected to span the next 20 to 50 years,  and local businesses are invited to set up on campus. The re-zoning issue now  moves to the Durham Planning Commission's August Agenda</p>

		<p><strong>Duke has to wait on rezoning</strong> <br />
	    News &amp; Observer, 12 July 2006</p>
		<p>The  planning commission delayed consideration of a Duke University  request to rezone 128 acres between the Gothic-style West Campus and the  Georgian-style East Campus.</p>
		<p>Duke  officials were encouraged to meet with neighborhood advocates to discuss their  concerns about the Central Campus plan before the commission reconsiders the  proposal next month.</p>
		<p>John Schelp and Tom Miller,  neighborhood representatives, sent a letter Monday to the commission asking the  advisory board for more time to work on thorny issues about the proposal.</p>

		<p><strong>Central  Campus vote postponed</strong> <br />
	    Herald-Sun, 12 July 2006</p>
		<p>The  Durham Planning Commission postponed a vote Tuesday on a rezoning request by Duke University  for its Central Campus redevelopment.</p>
		<p>The  commission moved the request and a public hearing to its August meeting.</p>
		<p>Several  people were prepared Tuesday to speak about Duke's plan for the 128-acre  property. As a preliminary step, Duke is seeking to  change its zoning designation from residential to university-college.</p>
		<p>Residents  of the site and surrounding neighborhoods said they would ask Duke  in the interim to specify more planned features, although they're not expecting  a high level of detail, said John   Schelp. They do want, however,  more information about planned retail operations, he said.</p>
		<p>&quot;Duke  knows exactly what we want,&quot; said Schelp, president of the Old West Durham  Neighborhood Association, &quot;and we're looking forward to doing what we did  with East and West campus, going in with them shoulder to shoulder.&quot;</p>
