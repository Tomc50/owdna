        <p><font color="Navy" size="2">&quot;<em>An apprehensive South, not unused 
          to picket lines, armed guards and business upheaval which accompany 
          labor unrest, girded itself tonight for what promised to be the greatest 
          strike in its history</em>.</font><font size="2">&quot;<br>
          -- Associated Press, Aug. 30, 1934 </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"> Seventy Labor Day weekends ago, Durham had more to 
          anticipate than Monday off. Come Tuesday, there was no telling what 
          might happen. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Fed up with low pay, short hours, pushy bosses, anti-union 
          tactics and the apparent indifference of industry overseers, workers 
          in Southern textile mills had been staging wildcat strikes since May. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The United Textile Workers of America, faced with a 
          labor movement running out of its control, had convened hastily and 
          called a strike nationwide, starting Saturday, Sept. 1. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Monday, Sept. 3, was Labor Day. For the first time, 
          Durham's mills took it as a holiday. But management insisted that they 
          would be open for business Tuesday.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"> Durham's textile plants employed more than 7,000 people. 
          They were organized to strike -- and they did.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"> By mid-September, every mill in Durham would be closed. 
          From Alabama to Maine, more than 400,000 workers would be out, 170,000 
          in the South alone. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">By the time the General Textile Strike of 1934 ended 
          on Sept. 23, 10,000 National Guard troops had been mobilized, and 20 
          people had been killed. One eyewitness called it &quot;the closest thing 
          to a revolution I've seen.&quot; One mill owner called it &quot;the 
          gravest emergency ... since Reconstruction.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Labor historian Mary Lethert Wingerd has written that 
          the strike left &quot;the textile unions broken.&quot; Conventional 
          wisdom holds that the strikers gained nothing. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Luther Riley, a West Durham striker, disagrees. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&quot;I think if the strike hadn't come along, the burden 
          would have got to the point people just couldn't stand it,&quot; Riley 
          said in an August interview. </font></p>
        <p> <font size="2"><em><font color="navy">&quot;You bet your life I will 
          strike. There is nothing else to do.&quot;<br>
          </font></em>-- Shorty Lee Evans, Erwin No. 4 worker, Sept. 3, 1934</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"> In 1934, Louis and Mary Williams Cole were children 
          in West Durham. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&quot;My daddy worked in the mill, and my brother,&quot; 
          Louis Cole said. &quot;They had tents set up by the gates, and people 
          would bring them food out. ... They did get a good bit of support from 
          the people of Durham.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Mayor W.F. Carr issued the city's Labor Day proclamation. 
          Ironically enough, he was vice president of the Durham Hosiery Mills. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">On Labor Day morning, a full-page newspaper ad proclaimed 
          &quot;In Union There Is Strength.&quot; It was sponsored by 18 local 
          businesses. Murdock Ice Co. announced that ice would be available on 
          credit during the strike. Many other Durham businesses were doing the 
          same. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Strike committees were in place at the Erwin mills in 
          West Durham, Pearl on Trinity Avenue, Golden Belt and East Durham Manufacturing 
          in Edgemont. Sept. 1, Saturday morning, 2,500 mill hands rallied at 
          the Carolina Theatre. By Sunday morning, strike posters were up all 
          over town. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">American Federation of Labor organizer Albert Beck, 
          busy in Durham for months, moved into a suite at the Washington Duke 
          hotel, with bodyguards. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Violence was a distinct possibility. The bloody Gastonia 
          mill strike of 1929 was still a cause cilhbre for leftists around the 
          world. In 1932, the Durham machine-gun company was put on alert for 
          strike duty in High Point. In 1933, the labor newspaper Hosiery Worker 
          described North Carolina as &quot;a real volcano,&quot; and a Durham 
          man, Clem Norwood, was killed in a strike in Philadelphia. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Earlier in 1934, strikes had led to riots in California 
          and Ohio. Durham workers were warned to look out for communist troublemakers 
          in their midst, and pro-Nazi groups called &quot;Silver Shirts&quot; 
          and &quot;Crusader White Shirts&quot; had appeared at labor trouble 
          spots. </font></p>
        <p> <font color="Navy" size="2"><em>&quot;We are going into this strike 
          not with the implements of war but with arms folded ... and we're not 
          going to tolerate any rough stuff.&quot;</em> <br>
          </font><font size="2">-- Albert Beck, Durham union organizer, Aug. 29, 
          1934 </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The momentum that led to the general strike had been 
          building for years. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Between falling demand and rising cotton prices, with 
          pay scales still elevated from the World War I boom, the highly competitive 
          textile industry was troubled, even before the Depression. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Manufacturers brought in new machines and efficiency 
          experts, laid off workers and drove the remaining employees to make 
          more with less. Overproduction made the situation worse. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&quot;The biggest thing that brought about the strike 
          was, you couldn't please the company,&quot; said Riley, a weaver at 
          Erwin Mills in 1934. &quot;There was only so much you could do with 
          a piece of machinery. The company wouldn't negotiate on anything.&quot; 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">For any disgruntled mill hand, there was no shortage 
          of unemployed ready to take his job, no matter how low the pay. A whisper 
          of &quot;union&quot; was enough to get a man fired, and, in mill villages 
          like West Durham, losing a job meant losing your home, too. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">In 1933, the Roosevelt administration enacted industrial 
          recovery measures that assured labor's liberty to organize, but also 
          allowed the textile industry to set production limits. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">In May 1934, the mills cut their operating hours -- 
          which meant cutting the hired help's hourly pay. At plant after plant, 
          employees answered by walking out, and talk began about a general strike. 
          </font></p>
        <p> <font color="Navy" size="2"><em>&quot;Up until 1934, there had never 
          been any labor trouble except one very minor case. ... But early in 
          1934, a movement was started to form a textile union in Durham.&quot;<br>
          </em></font><font size="2">-- Kemp P. Lewis, &quot;Annual Report of 
          the President of The Erwin Cotton Mills Co.,&quot; Jan 26, 1935 </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Labor organizing was not new in Durham. But the textile 
          mills had staved it off by providing worker amenities, keeping wages 
          relatively high while reducing the work week, and allowing labor some 
          say in how the plants were run. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Still, in early 1934, a flier went around town. On one 
          side was an open letter from the American Federation of Labor detailing 
          the organizing provisions of the National Industrial Recovery Act. The 
          other side announced a &quot;Special Organization Meeting&quot; for 
          textile workers, March 10 at West Durham High School. R.R. Lawrence, 
          president of the N.C. Federation of Labor, spoke on &quot;Why I Should 
          Join the Union.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Unions were established in Durham's two cigarette factories 
          by the end of 1933, and in the spring of 1934, even cafi staff and retail 
          clerks were organizing. Candidates in that spring's local election were 
          so united in support of labor that the Labor Voters' League could not 
          choose whom to endorse. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&quot;We had good leadership,&quot; said Riley, the 
          Erwin Mills weaver, &quot;and they tried to explain what was going on, 
          and people knew what was going on.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Labor Day morning, more than 4,000 people gathered for 
          a memorial service at Clem Norwood's grave. William Smith, an officer 
          of the American Federation of Hosiery Workers, told them to show solidarity 
          and courage to end &quot;the conditions which lead to killings ... in 
          strike situations.&quot; And he called textile companies &quot;the Judases 
          of the New Deal.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Support for the strike, however, was not unanimous. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&quot;We will be on picket duty early tomorrow morning,&quot; 
          Catherine Clements and Ernestine Kerr of East Durham Cotton said that 
          day. &quot;To switch a few girls who we know who are not members of 
          our union.&quot; </font></p>
        <p> <font color="navy" size="2"><em>&quot;It was all right there for a 
          couple of weeks, but then that thing began to turn and there was some 
          people who went hungry.&quot;</em> <br>
          </font><font size="2">-- I.L. Dean, merchant, in &quot;An Oral History 
          of West Durham&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">On Tuesday morning, picket lines that union leaders 
          called &quot;impregnable barricades&quot; surrounded 12 Durham mills. 
          The Sun newspaper reported 4,000 out on strike.</font></p>
        <p> <font size="2">&quot;There was no hint of violence or disorder. For 
          the most part, the strikers laughed and exchanged pleasantries. Pastors 
          from churches in the mill neighborhoods were on hand early to watch 
          the proceedings.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Not everyone felt so festive. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Mayor Carr was allowed into his office at the Hosiery 
          Mill -- &quot;for a little while&quot; -- but he was the only exception. 
          Mill executives were turned away like anyone else trying to go to work. 
          Some managers went home in tears. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&quot;It is naturally galling to an American citizen 
          to have a mob refuse to allow him entrance into his own office,&quot; 
          wrote Kemp P. Lewis, president of the Erwin Mills Co., in his 1934 annual 
          report. &quot;And our first impulse, of course, was to call on the city 
          and county authorities for sufficient police protection to open up the 
          gates.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Sheriff E.G. &quot;Cat&quot; Belvin and Police Chief 
          G.W. Proctor had pledged to keep the peace. But neither was inclined 
          to intervene, and management thought better of pushing the issue. Peace 
          prevailed, but not unanimity. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&quot;You had a lot of friction going between the strikers 
          and non-strikers,&quot; Louis Cole said. &quot;You had some arrests, 
          there were some fights.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Mary Cole's father was a union president in West Durham. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&quot;We'd go out on strike, and some would go back,&quot; 
          she said. &quot;As hard as he worked, and they would turn and go back 
          to work.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">All Durham's mills were closed, but credit only went 
          so far, union strike funds ran low, and men without jobs were anxious 
          to take strikers' places. Meantime, reports came of what was going on 
          elsewhere. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Unions sent &quot;flying squadrons&quot; to shut down 
          mills still operating. They were met with armed residents, police and 
          militia. In Georgia, state troops arrested more than 100 strikers and 
          interred them in a former prisoner-of-war camp. In Rhode Island, troops 
          ran out of tear gas trying to control a riot involving 5,000 strikers. 
          In Honea Path, S.C., seven strikers were shot dead. In Belmont, two 
          were bayoneted; one died. </font></p>
        <p> <font size="2"><em><font color="navy">&quot;My two oldest boys are 
          so bitter toward the union they don't even like to hear the word mentioned.&quot;</font><br>
          </em>-- Eve Hardison, wife of an East Durham textile worker, to WPA 
          interviewer on Aug. 23, 1938 </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">On Sept. 18, Socialist politician Norman Thomas spoke 
          to a crowd of 1,500 at the Durham Athletic Park. He said the textile 
          walkout was &quot;the largest industrial strike on record&quot; and 
          had met with &quot;amazing success.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">By then, though, by the hundreds and thousands, strikers 
          were going back to work. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&quot;People were tired,&quot; Riley said. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">A presidential commission proposed a settlement. On 
          Sept. 22, the strike was called off. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&quot;Things got better,&quot; Riley said. &quot;Supervision 
          let up a good deal.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">In Durham, mill owners pledged not to discriminate against 
          strikers. But when mills reopened elsewhere, many union members found 
          they had no more jobs and were blacklisted throughout the industry. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Unions remained strong in Durham until the industries 
          that supported them disappeared. But many mill families across the region 
          felt the union had led them on and then deserted them. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Wages remained low, production pressure high. Blacklists, 
          layoffs and blunt force left bitter memories. Still, former strikers 
          and non-strikers had to live with each other. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&quot;One way to deal with that sort of thing is to 
          repress it,&quot; said John Shelton Reed, a retired UNC sociologist. 
          &quot;It did sort of disappear from the collective memory.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Reed, a native of Kingsport, Tenn., said he never heard 
          about it until he was grown. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&quot;It was just mutual understanding; we won't talk 
          about it,&quot; he said. </font></p>
