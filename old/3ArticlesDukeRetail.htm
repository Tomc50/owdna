          proposal </font><br>
          <font size="2">(Herald-Sun, 9 September 2003)</font></strong></p>
        <p>The public is invited to a hearing tonight on Duke<br>
          University's massive rezoning request before the<br>
          Zoning Committee, a group that advises the City<br>
          Council. </p>
        <p>The 6 p.m. hearing in the City Council Chambers of<br>
          City Hall follows months of sometimes contentious<br>
          meetings between representatives from Duke and the 12<br>
          neighborhoods that border it. The Zoning Committee is<br>
          expected to recommend that the City Council approve<br>
          the rezoning request. </p>
        <p>If passed, the rezoning would create a new<br>
          university-college district, placing new restrictions<br>
          on perimeter areas of campus, while giving the<br>
          university more flexibility in internal campus areas. </p>
        <p>Neighborhood and university representatives have<br>
          hammered out a development plan they say will ensure<br>
          that new construction on the fringes of campus doesn't<br>
          mar the character of neighborhoods such as Watts<br>
          Hospital-Hillandale Neighborhood, Old West Durham and<br>
          Trinity Heights. </p>
        <p>The plan calls for preserving open space, limiting new<br>
          parking on East Campus and enlarging buffers between<br>
          neighboring homes and Duke construction, among other<br>
          things. It offers written protections for Duke's<br>
          neighbors as the university gets set to rezone more<br>
          than 1,400 campus acres. </p>
        <p>John Schelp, who represented residents of the 12<br>
          neighborhoods in the negotiations, said Duke and its<br>
          neighbors are ready to go forth with the rezoning. </p>
        <p>&quot;I expect that we'll walk in shoulder-to-shoulder with<br>
          Duke in support of the rezoning,&quot; Schelp said...</p>
        <p><strong><font color="#006600">Rezoning for Duke cleared by committee</font><br> 
            <font size="2">(Herald-Sun, 10 September 2003)</font> </strong></p>
        <p>With little fanfare that belied the months of<br>
          negotiations between Duke University and its<br>
          neighbors, the City-County Zoning Committee gave the<br>
          university a unanimous nod Tuesday to rezone more than<br>
          1,400 acres. </p>
        <p>The Zoning Committee's 5-0 approval pushes the massive<br>
          rezoning one step closer to fruition. One committee<br>
          member, Duke employee Lynn VanScoyoc, excused herself<br>
          from voting. </p>
        <p>The City Council will make the final decision on the<br>
          plan in late October or early November. </p>
        <p>If passed, the rezoning would place about 738 acres of<br>
          West and Central campuses under a new<br>
          university-college district, with new restrictions on<br>
          perimeter areas of campus and more flexibility for the<br>
          university in internal campus areas. </p>
        <p>About 666 acres from five different areas of campus,<br>
          including East Campus and swaths of land near the<br>
          Washington Duke Inn, would fall under even more strict<br>
          guidelines thanks to a development plan negotiated by<br>
          officials from Duke and representatives of the 12<br>
          neighborhoods that surround it. </p>
        <p>Among other things, the 11-point development plan<br>
          preserves open space, limits new parking, enlarges<br>
          buffers between neighboring homes and Duke<br>
          construction, and even limits the expansion of the<br>
          university president's house on Pinecrest Road to no<br>
          more than 20 percent of its current size. </p>
        <p>It took several months and a few tense moments for<br>
          Duke and its neighbors to work out the plan's extra<br>
          protections. During a public hearing before the vote<br>
          Tuesday night, John Schelp, who along with Tom Miller<br>
          represented the neighborhoods throughout the process,<br>
          issued a simple statement. </p>
        <p>&quot;Never has so much time and effort gone into these<br>
          four words: 'We support the rezoning,' &quot; he said. </p>
        <p>Zoning Committee Chairwoman Jackie Brown said she<br>
          appreciated the effort Duke made toward the<br>
          neighborhoods. </p>
        <p>After the vote, John Burness, Duke's senior vice<br>
          president of public relations, said he was pleased<br>
          with the result. </p>
        <p>&quot;Obviously, we worked very hard with Miller and Schelp<br>
          to find common ground,&quot; he said. &quot;While at times it<br>
          wasn't pretty, everybody was working in a good-faith<br>
          effort.&quot; </p>
        <p>The university pulled a section of West Campus out of<br>
          the rezoning application, but the land likely will<br>
          come before the City-County Planning Department some<br>
          other time. Duke eventually could build a set of<br>
          mixed-use buildings there that will include a small<br>
          hotel, &quot;limited retail&quot; shops and restaurants near<br>
          student apartments off Erwin Road. </p>
        <p>Some residents remained concerned that a new retail<br>
          area would take business away from Brightleaf Square,<br>
          Ninth Street and portions of downtown. But Duke<br>
          officials insist that any new development would only<br>
          enhance the area. </p>
        <p>Some of the protections afforded by the development<br>
          plan include: </p>
        <p>-- Continued maintenance of the jogging trail near<br>
          Washington Duke Inn. </p>
        <p>-- 250-foot buffers next to homes along the southern<br>
          perimeter of campus and extending north and east<br>
          toward Duke University Road and Alexander Avenue and<br>
          south and west to Academy Road. </p>
        <p>-- No parking decks and no more than 100 new parking<br>
          spaces on East Campus. </p>
        <p>-- A 250-foot buffer from the perimeter of East<br>
          Campus, with the exception of the academic/music<br>
          building and a new planned dormitory. </p>
        <p>-- Limiting all new and renovated East Campus<br>
          buildings to a height of 75 feet. </p>
        <p>-- Preserving the wall around East Campus. </p>
        <p>-- A pledge to consult neighbors if the need ever<br>
          arose to build an 8-foot security fence on top of the<br>
          wall. </p>
        <p>-- Modifying over time the existing athletic field<br>
          lights on East Campus to reduce the ambient light. </p>
        <p><strong><font color="#006600">Durham OKs change for college zoning: Ordinance<br>
          creates new restrictions for perimeter areas</font><br>
          <font size="2">(Herald-Sun, 8 April 2003)</font></strong></p>
        <p>The Durham City Council unanimously approved a new<br>
          University-College Zoning District on Monday that<br>
          seeks to ease the transitions from Duke, N.C. Central<br>
          and Durham Tech into their surrounding neighborhoods. </p>
        <p>Generally, the zoning ordinance allows educational<br>
          uses such as dormitories, arenas and libraries as well<br>
          as &quot;ancillary&quot; educational uses such as medical<br>
          centers, teaching hospitals and research labs. It<br>
          creates new restrictions for perimeter areas of<br>
          campus, while allowing more flexibility in internal<br>
          campus areas. </p>
        <p>In a section that proved controversial, it also allows<br>
        &quot;limited retail uses&quot; such as dining halls and<br>
          bookstores that serve the &quot;on-campus&quot; populations. </p>
        <p>The council was scheduled to vote on the new zoning<br>
          category in February but postponed it after<br>
          neighborhood groups around Duke University were caught<br>
          off guard and wanted more time to review it. </p>
        <p>After meetings between the involved parties,<br>
          neighborhood leaders said they thought they had come<br>
          to agreement on the language in the ordinance. </p>
        <p>But Duke officials later began lobbying the city for<br>
          broader commercial uses. City-County Planning Director<br>
          Frank Duke said university officials &quot;actively&quot;<br>
          lobbied for the city to drop the word &quot;limited&quot; from<br>
          the section about retail uses. The university also<br>
          lobbied for language that would allow retail uses<br>
          serving the &quot;campus population,&quot; instead of the more<br>
          limited &quot;on-campus population.&quot; </p>
        <p>&quot;The effect of these changes would be that any retail<br>
          designed to serve a population between the ages of 18<br>
          and 65 would be a permitted use,&quot; Duke wrote in an<br>
          e-mail. &quot;In effect, Duke is requesting the language be<br>
          changed to permit a Streets of Southpoint as a<br>
          permitted use on the campus.&quot; </p>
        <p>In response, neighborhood leaders last week accused<br>
          the university of going behind their backs. They said<br>
          more commercial development within Duke would hurt<br>
          commercial areas outside the campus, such as Ninth<br>
          Street, and make the campus even more isolated from<br>
          the city. </p>
        <p>&quot;Quite frankly, I feel as though Duke has dealt with<br>
          us in something less than good faith,&quot; Watts<br>
          Hospital-Hillandale Neighborhood Association President<br>
          Tom Miller wrote in an e-mail to Duke President Nan<br>
          Keohane. </p>
        <p>But on Monday, planning director Duke said the<br>
          university was dropping its request for more<br>
          commercial flexibility, and neighborhood<br>
          representatives who attended Monday&rsquo;s meeting said<br>
          they are pleased with the final outcome. </p>
        <p>Under the zoning, new buildings in the internal areas<br>
          would be restricted to 120 feet in height, or 145 feet<br>
          with a Major Special Use Permit, which requires a more<br>
          thorough review. </p>
        <p>Rules for the &quot;perimeter&quot; areas adjacent to<br>
          nonuniversity properties are stricter. For example,<br>
          building heights can&rsquo;t be more than 150 percent of the<br>
          average height of adjacent buildings. Also, the<br>
          facades of &quot;perimeter&quot; buildings are required to have<br>
          designs that are compatible with the surrounding area.<br>
        </p>
        <p>The ordinance applies to all of Durham&rsquo;s colleges and<br>
          universities. But the universities aren&rsquo;t required to<br>
          place their properties in the new district. Instead<br>
          they can choose to keep their properties under<br>
          existing zoning, which is similar to that of other<br>
          private property around the city, designated in<br>
          categories such as residential, office or commercial. </p>
        <p>Frank Duke said Duke University officials had informed<br>
          him that, in response to the language about commercial<br>
          use, they would likely keep a large portion of their<br>
        &quot;central campus&quot; property around the medical center<br>
          under its current zoning. <br>
