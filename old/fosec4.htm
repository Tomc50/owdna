  (Neuse River Notes, NRF newsletter, Spring 2000) 
<p>The Neuse River Foundation regularly involves itself in educating the public 
  about river protection and the threats to the Neuse. Although we work endlessly 
  to strengthen environmental policies and enforcement, we know that protecting 
  the river only happens when local people get involved. When communities take 
  responsibility for protecting their watershed, they should be recognized. Here 
  we highlights the efforts of a group in the Upper Neuse, the Friends of South 
  Ellerbe Creek. This multi-community group tells the story of Durham's history 
  that should be preserved. 
<p>One of their primary goals is to work for the creation of an urban green space 
  along the banks of South Ellerbe in Old West Durham. To this end, they have 
  organized a letter writing campaign to show the City Council how much the people 
  of Durham want a proposed park in order to protect the creek, Durham's history, 
  and to encourage its appreciation as something other than a conveyance for sewage 
  and trash. 
<p>The group has also adopted S.Ellerbe Creek through the state's StreamWatch 
  program, started a storm drain marking program with local elementary schools, 
  and organized several clean-ups. Please read the following excerpts from their 
  website:<indent next 3 paragraphs> 
<ul>
  <li>The headwaters of S. Ellerbe rise next to what was once the settlement of 
    Pinhook, which served as a traveler's rest on the dirt road between Hillsborough 
    and Raleigh. From its headwaters, South Ellerbe Creek flows for three miles 
    through some of Durham's oldest and most densely developed neighborhoods: 
    Old West Durham, Walltown, Northgate Park, Trinity Park. Another branch of 
    South Ellerbe flows north out of downtown Durham, through Durham Central Park 
    and Trinity Park -- before joining her sister near Club Blvd Elementary.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>South Ellerbe meets Ellerbe Creek in a wooded area -- just to the north 
    and west of the I-85/ Roxboro Road interchange. The first mile of the creek 
    is surrounded by various auto and muffler shops, large surface parking lots, 
    a plumbing shop, funeral home, photo studio, small apartment complex, Southern 
    Railroad, Business Hwy 70, a Duke warehouse, an old gas station, and a number 
    of quiet back yards. Its path will take it past three schools: E.K. Powe Elementary, 
    Brogden Middle and Club Blvd Elementary. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> And, the course of South Ellerbe Creek follows the history of Durham itself. 
    Blue collar in its origins, South Ellerbe flows through some of the Bull City's 
    most historic neighborhoods: Old West Durham was built for workers in the 
    textile mills and Walltown for workers in the tobacco industry. From its confluence 
    with Ellerbe Creek, the waters flow to Falls Lake. From there, the Neuse River 
    begins its journey to the Atlantic Ocean. The path of South Ellerbe Creek 
    is quite a story from its headwaters near Hillsborough Road, passing through 
    history, absorbing some of the city's ills and flowing through forests and 
    farms to the coast. </li>
</ul>
