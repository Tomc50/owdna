      <p>More than half the City's population lives in the Ellerbe Creek watershed. 
        That large population places greater stress on the stream, but also provides 
        greater opportunities for citizen involvement. Stream cleanups by citizen 
        groups like Friends of South Ellerbe Creek do more than raise awareness 
        - they foster pride and stewardship.<br>

      <p>Thank you for the introduction of Friends of the South Ellerbe Creek! 
        I was somewhat familiar with it's history, but certainly not to this degree. 
        My sincere thanks on the excellent education. I will splash through the 
        site as invited!!!<br>
        <b><font size="2">--P. Lamont Ewell [Durham City Manager] </font></b></p>
      <p> Thanks for sending me information on the South Ellerbe website and the 
        history. It is very interesting. I appreciate the work that the Friends 
        of South Ellerbe Creek have undertaken.<br>
        <b><font size="2">-- Ellen Reckhow Durham County Commissioner </font></b></p>
      <p> Thanks for pointing me to the [FOSEC] site. Great job.<br>
        <b><font size="2"> --Nick Tennyson [Mayor of Durham] </font></b></p>
      <p>Thanks for your infomation about the work of FOSEC. Your group is doing 
        important work! My husband and I have been involved with preservation 
        of the Eno River for about 30 years, and we understand the effort to cleanup 
        and keep clean a stream. Keep it up and keep me informed.<br>
        <font size="2"><b>-- Becky Heron (County Commissioner) </b></font></p>
      <p>Please keep me informed about topics or events that you would like us 
        to participate. I look forward to working with you.<br>

      <p>I salute the Friends of South Ellerbe Creek. As a member of Trout Unlimited, 
        I am amazed at the power grassroots organizations have to preserve and 
        protect our natural resources.<br>

      <p> What you folks are doing is wonderful. I loved the pictures on your 
        website. We would like the opportunity to discuss with you and your group 
        what we could do to help support your goals. We have resources for training 
        volunteers & supplying water quality testing kits, experience in bringing 
        legal actions against polluters and the ability to get grants for urban 
        stream restoration, etc...<br>

      <p> I recently took a look at the FOSEC web page. It looks like a great 
        start to increase public awareness about a local stream. I hope other 
        small watersheds groups will try to do the same. DWQ encourages this type 
        of project and will help when possible. Although we can address of many 
        larger issues, it is really important that local efforts on small watersheds 
        get off the ground when it comes to water quality concerns. Put me on 
        your list.<br>
        <font size="2"><b>-- Cam McNutt [Division of Water Quality/DENR] </b></font></p>
      <p> Thank you for your Stream Watch proposal form. I have Stream Watch metal 
        signs and... I will have to special order the smaller sign which will 
        say "Friends of South Ellerbe Creek". I normally send one sign/group but 
        will send you three. Thanks for keeping an eye on your adopted creek and 
        if I can be of assistance please do not hesitate to call. <br>
        <font size="2"><b>-- David [NC Stream Watch/DENR] </b></font></p>
      <p> Thank you for sending information about your watershed activities! You 
        will be happy to know we have registered the Friends of South Ellerbe 
        Creek in our database. We will be sending a certificate of appreciation 
        in recognition of your group's efforts. Keep up the great work and thanks 
        for your message.<br>

      <p> Terrific website!! It really is great. My pleasure as well to run into 
        you in the neighborhood. I bet our walking paths will cross again and 
        again... I have been in Durham for almost 20 years and had no idea that 
        South Ellerbe runs the long course that it does. <br>
        <font size="2"><b>-- Martin [Self-Help Credit Union] </b></font></p>
      <p> I read with great interest your three e-mails as well as your website. 
        Your neighborhood is very fortunate to have someone like you who is totally 
        committed to a cleaner environment, particularly in your neighborhood 
        creek. <br>
        <font size="2"><b>-- B. Wilson [Storm Water Services, Durham] </b></font></p>
      <p>Hi everyone, I have disappeared since the creek cleanup way back in the 
        spring, but I have been following your work with the creek/greenspace 
        project from afar. It makes me laugh with joy to see how much progress 
        you have made. Keep up the good work and I hope to see you all when I 
        get back to town in November. <br>

      <p>Thank you much for the information! I was looking for a way to involve 
        students, in addition to letter writing, in a current and important environmental 
        concern. Once our community becomes aware as to what is at stake or what 
        the possibilities are for S. Ellerbe Creek, we can begin to involve students 
        in meaningful activities that will make a difference. I have also spoken 
        with two Duke Environmental Education students who volunteer time to work 
        with our fifth grade classes about the issues. It is possible that they 
        can help lead teams to place stickers on storm drains project. I'm really 
        excited about the educational value and the possibilities! Thank you again 
        for you help. I'll let you know when we will be placing stickers on storm 
        drains. Please let me know if we can lend support to the project etc.

      <p> Thank you for sending me this story. I wish more people were as interested 
        in their watersheds as your group is. I am forwarding this message to 
        Darlene Kucken, who manages our Basinwide Management Program, and Alan 
        Clark, who manages our Planning Branch, as it may be of interest to them 
        and their staff.<br>

      <p> Loved the web site(s). Really impressive. Loaded really quickly, easy 
        to use and follow, useful info., not too much. See ya. <br>

      <p> Nice site -- and great map! the last time I walked from Club Blvd along 
        Ellerbe Creek to the confluence with S. Ellerbee Creek I was struck that 
        a) Ellerbe Creek was in decent shape, at least until the noise of I-85 
        deafened me, and b) by how horrible S. Ellerbe Creek seemed -- full of 
        trash, shopping carts and tires, and covered with a very foul looking 
        chemical soup. It also reeked of oil or gas down there. Glad I didn't 
        strike a match. It was a horrible experience overall... <br>
        Regards, <br>

      <p>This is so wonderful. Everyone in our office came to read your e-mail 
        and now the entire office is excited. I am forwarding it to Lisa Tolley 
        and Linda Rhoads, our river basin adult education team, and I know they 
        will be in touch shortly. You are doing such a great thing - we really 
        do want to be a part of it and perhaps some of our initiatives on "Know 
        Your Ecological Address" can contribute to your work.<br>
        <font size="2"><b>-- Ann [Director of Public Education/DENR] </b></font></p>
      <p>Sure enough! great web page - especially like the kayaker on Ninth! Have 
        you formally adopted this stream? I have informally adopted the Northeast 
        Creek (my sub-basin of the New Hope/Cape Fear) and am working on getting 
        the Carpenter Fletcher Neighborhood Association to formally do the same, 
        in these manners.<br>
        <b><font size="2">-- Pete [EPA & Carpenter-Fletcher neighborhood activist]

      <p>Thanks for this information, I don't live around there but I will pass 
        this along to everyone here.<br>
        <font size="2"><b>-- Ina [Glaxo-Wellcome] </b></font></p>
      <p> I'll share with others. Thanks for letting all of us know. I knew nothing 
        of this. <br>

      <p>In my official capacity as Executive Director of Durham Central Park, 
        I thank you for your efforts and those of others who showed up for the 
        cleaning of the South Ellerbe Creek last weekend. Although I am sad to 
        say that other clean-ups will have to take place in the future, your group 
        exemplifies what is right about Durham. Keep up the good work.<br>
