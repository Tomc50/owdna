      <p><tt>February 18, 2002</tt></p>
      <p><tt>Dear Richard Valzonis:</tt></p>
      <p><tt>I am Vice President of the Old West Durham Neighborhood Association. 
        I am forwarding to you a copy of an email I sent to Charlene Montford 
        this morning about "repairs" being done by Lee Ray Bergman to a property 
        that caught fire in December and was subsequently condemned.</tt></p>
      <p><tt>As I explain in my letter, we have had two fires in Old West Durham 
        since December, at least 4 in the past two years, and substandard, poorly 
        maintained rental properties have been an ongoing source of concern in 
        our neighborhood. We are fortunate that, at least thus far, these fires 
        have not resulted in any loss of human life. But the frequency of these 
        fires reveals a deep need for inspection, repair, and maintenance of substandard 
        and run-down rental properties in our neighborhood to insure that they 
        meet at least minimum housing codes, that landlords are forced to adhere 
        to occupancy requirements, and that these codes and requirements are enforced. 
        </tt></p>
      <p><tt>Please get back to me about the Bergman property and about how to 
        follow-up on and end the dangers posed by poorly maintained, substandard 
        rental properties.</tt></p>
      <p><tt>Sincerely,</tt></p>

        to <a href="mailto:cmontford@ci.durham.nc.us">Charlene Montford</a>, Director, 
        Durham Housing and Community Development:</b></font></tt></p>
      <p><tt>February 18, 2002</tt></p>
      <p><tt>Dear Charlene Montford:</tt></p>
      <p><tt>I'm writing to express my concern about "repair" work apparently 
        being done on a (former) duplex at 1020 Alabama Ave. This duplex, owned 
        by Lee Ray Bergman, was completely gutted by fire in December--the entire 
        front wall of the house is gone, as is part of the roof and parts of other 
        walls; the doors and windows are all gone, boarded with plywood, and the 
        inside was completely destroyed by the fire. I have seen the inspection 
        report that was done after the fire, and it states that the wiring and 
        plumbing systems were destroyed by the fire.</tt></p>
      <p><tt>At the time of the fire there were 7 adult males living in the duplex, 
        in clear violation of the minimum square footage/occupant requirement 
        in the housing code. Despite the fact that the duplex was nearly completely 
        destroyed by fire, a new electrical box was put up and Bergman is apparently 
        planning to "renovate" and rerent this property. </tt></p>
      <p><tt>This property was poorly maintained before the fire, and, given its 
        number of occupants, Bergman Rentals clearly did a poor job of monitoring 
        it. I am greatly concerned that Bergman is attempting to repair a property 
        that is currently condemned and seems an appropriate candidate only for 
        razing--especially given his proven track record of inadequately maintaining 
        this property.</tt></p>
      <p><tt>My questions: 1) Is it legal to repair a property that has been so 
        severely burned? 2) If it is legal, who is responsible for making certain 
        that the building is structurally sound (I cannot believe, given the severity 
        of the fire, that the foundation, floor supports, rafters, or walls are 
        sound or usable and the inspection report states that there is no plumbing 
        or wiring intact) and that any work done is done safely, done well, and 
        meets codes? 3) How can I be informed that this work is being inspected 
        and can the inspector(s) be instructed to send me copies of all their 
        inspection reports?</tt></p>
      <p><tt>My neighborhood has suffered two fires since December, the fire at 
        1020 Alabama and a second at 2707 Lawndale. These fires were within walking 
        distance of each other and both were in rental properties that were poorly 
        maintained. Clearly, we need to figure out a way to insure that these 
        rental properties are inspected and that landlords be required to bring 
        them to code, maintain them, and enforce occupancy requirements. </tt></p>
      <p><tt>Please email me and let me know what you plan to do about the Bergman 
        property at 1020 Alabama and send me copies of any inspection reports 
        that are done.</tt></p>
      <p><tt>Sincerely,</tt></p>
