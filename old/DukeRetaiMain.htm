          </strong>-(News &amp; Observer, Feb 17, 2005)</p>
        <p>Duke University Provost Peter Lange and Michael Palmer, director of
          Duke's Office of Community Affairs, spent much of the evening offering
          
          general answers to specific questions about the economic and social
          impact Central Campus changes could have on Durham. Some community
          members 
          fear that a lavishly appointed Central Campus will create a cocoon
          for  Duke students, giving them little reason to spend their money
          and time 
          off campus...</p>
        <p>Kelly Jarrett, who is vice president of the Old West Durham Neighborhood
          Association and a Duke employee, compared the school's refusal to
          eliminate 
          the possibility of mass-market commercial development to the behavior
          of a 700-pound gorilla...</p>
        <p>Duke has formed four committees charged with examining various aspects
          of Central Campus development such as housing and dining, academic
          programs 
          and spaces, and community affairs. None of the committees includes
          Durham  residents free of educational or financial ties to the university.<br />

          open on a university zone are property-tax exempt, which some Duke
          neighbors  have charged would provide retailers with an unfair advantage.</p>
        <p>Members of the audience also urged the University to add local residents

        <p class="style9">The construction of Central Campus has not yet started,
          but already several of Duke's neighbors feel like the University
          is 
          proceeding with steamrollers. Local businesses and neighbors are frustrated
          with their lack of information and input about the University's
          plans 
          for developing Central. They are concerned that in its zeal to make
          Central Campus an appealing student destination, the University
          will 
          overdevelop the retail offerings and overstep the bounds of its educational
          mission. </p>

        <p><font size="3">The InterNeighborhood Council of Durham voted Tuesday
          night to support a proposed university-college ordinance for Duke's
          
          Central Campus, which [adjoins] the Old West Durham neighborhood near
          Ninth Street.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">INC members agreed that the following businesses should

          shop, a performing arts center, a 99-room hotel, a Duke apparel store
          and a bowling alley. Duke is exempt under state law from paying
          taxes, 
          and some worry that will give on-campus merchants an unfair advantage. </font></p>

          plan to develop its campus could encroach on local businesses </font></strong><font size="3"><br />
            (The Chronicle of Higher Education, 18 June 2004)</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">This stretch of Ninth Street and the surrounding area
          just a few blocks from Duke University's East Campus has long been
          an 
          off-campus outlet where Duke students and local residents socialize
          while supporting a business district that is an integral part of
          Old 
          West Durham... Duke says it simply wants to serve its students better.
          But some merchants suspect that the university is pursuing a strategy
          
          to keep more student dollars on the campus while providing retail options
          that would also appeal to local residents... The tension recalls
          the 
          days when Duke's neighbors and others in the city saw the university
          as an isolated, arrogant, and sometimes clumsy behemoth that had
          little 
          outward regard for local folk. </font></p>
        <p><em><font color="Navy">&quot;Ninth Street has character, a quality
          sadly lacking in Duke's plans. I jumped at the chance to move
          my business 
          to Ninth Street ... because it's the last place in Durham where you
          can walk up and down the street, window-shop, and chat with your
          neighbors 
          and experience town life.&quot;</font></em><font color="Navy"><br />

        <p><font size="3">Duke's neighbors have supported hospital and campus
          rezoning as well as a variety of creative, exciting projects for
          Duke. 
          In return, the proposed Central Campus plans will establish serious,
          property-tax free competition to the business districts of Ninth
          Street, 
          Brightleaf Square and Main Street. This unfair advantage for Duke,
          if  allowed by City Council, would be even more outrageous than the
          contradictory 
          statements and false promises Duke's neighbors have come to expect.
          No matter what university officials want us to believe, what's good

        <p><font size="3">The city does have increasingly desperate needs. Especially
          if Duke is going to compete with local businesses above and beyond
          the 
          scope of its educational mission, then it ought to pay its fair share
          like everyone else. But whether or not they should pay taxes, it's
          clear 
          that the fact they don't pay any has a big effect on the tax bill of
          those of us who do. What would Durham's budget be like -- meaning,
          how 
          low would taxes be, or how big a surplus would we have if the biggest
          landowner and employer in the county paid taxes like other companies?</font></p>

          security measures that Duke University instituted after four armed
          robberies 
          on or near campus last fall criticized the university Friday for walling
          itself off from the community.</font> </p>
        <p><font size="3">Duke's security measures have drawn the ire of folks
          like graduate student Simon Hay, who argued in an e-mail, signed
          by 
          60 other graduate students, undergraduates and professors, that Duke
          was closing itself off from the community in the name of security. &quot;At
          Duke, language of security means control of resources, where Duke
          wants 
          to keep students out of Durham and keep their money on Duke's campus,&quot; Hay

        <p><font size="3">The Old West Durham Neighborhood Association seems
          at  the end of its patience with Duke University over development
          issues, 
          and that's too bad for both parties. Old West Durham president John
          Schelp said last week Duke is more interested in what it wants to
          do 
          than in fostering a true partnership with adjacent neighborhoods...
          Duke has raised justifiable ire within the Old West Durham group
          with 
          its plans for rebuilding Central Campus, including more space for retail
          than Old West Durham says it agreed to. Schelp and others fear that
          
          too much tax-exempt retail in Central Campus would affect Ninth Street,
          Brightleaf Square and even Northgate Mall. These are legitimate
          concerns... 
          Duke for its part needs to compromise with Old West Durham to the fullest
          extent possible, and win back the neighborhood's trust. </font></p>

        <p><font size="3">Donna Lisker, director of Duke's Women's Center, stressed
          that trying to keep people off campus wouldn't prevent most of the
          sexual 
          assaults on Duke students. The Women's Center receives about 40 reports
          of sexual assault each year, she said, and generally only one report
          
          involves an attack from a stranger. Although trying to prevent stranger
          rape is important, Lisker said, women students should not ignore
          the 
          greater risk they actually face.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Prof. Lubiano said she understands what it's like to
          feel vulnerable: She is a rape survivor, her brother was killed
          in a 
          liquor-store robbery and her sister-in-law worked in the part of the
          Pentagon attacked on September 11. Despite this, she said, she doesn't
          
          believe in trying to separate Duke from the community in the name of
          security.</font></p>

        <p><font size="3">Duke's neighbors said the University was slowly pulling
          into its own bubble, isolating itself from the city it calls home. &quot;It
          appears from the outside that Duke has very much a fortress mentality

          David Smith, president 
          of the Trinity Park Neighborhood Association, said he has also heard

          Campus  Redevelopment in Durham, N.C</strong></font>. <br />
            <font size="3">(Miami Herald, 11 March 2004) </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Duke University administrators spelled out long-range
          plans for the redevelopment of Central Campus at a neighborhood
          meeting 
          Wednesday, repeating one message over and over: Duke doesn't want to
          hurt businesses on Ninth Street or other commercial districts. But
          many 
          of the merchants in Duke's formidable shadow were not convinced, after
          looking at 50-year plans for a hotel, auditorium, restaurants, offices,
          
          shops and new housing in the 200-acre wedge between East and West campuses. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">&quot;It doesn't benefit students to stay closeted
          in  what I'm calling 'Dukieland,&quot; instead of Disneyland,&quot; said
          Skip Anderson, owner of the Zola Craft Gallery on Ninth Street.
          He thought 
          the new Central Campus would further isolate Duke students and visitors
          from the rest of the town. &quot;It's a mental wall created by Duke,
          by providing for every single student need on campus,&quot; he
          said.</font> </p>

          new  retail</font></strong> <font size="3"><br />
            (Herald-Sun, 28 December 2003) </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">On-campus retail would have an impact on the business
          districts surrounding Duke. Vacant storefronts along West Chapel
          Hill 
          Street in the West End, Brightleaf Square, downtown and Ninth Street
          would harm the very neighborhoods Duke is trying to help. Also,
          existing 
          small businesses would be at a disadvantage because Duke's on-campus
          retail shops wouldn't have to pay property taxes. Finally, creating
          
          an on-campus retail cocoon would further isolate Duke students from
          Durham... So Duke faces a decision. Will it violate its agreement
          with 
          the partnership neighborhoods? Will it exceed its academic mission
          and  pursue on-campus retail that would harm small businesses in
          Durham? 
          The ball is in Duke's court. </font></p>

          Duke's two-story apartments complex on Central Campus with a development
          that might include a limited number of retail shops. Initially the
          university 
          asked for the ordinance to allow unlimited retail uses that would not
          be restricted to students. After Old West Durham and Watts-Hillandale
          
          leaders (representing the 12 Duke-Durham partnership neighborhoods)
          expressed concerns that such a development could hurt nearby businesses

  &quot;Retail uses, such as university-related bookstores<br />
