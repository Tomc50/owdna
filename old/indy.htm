        <P> 
        <P>Long before diversity became a popular term, Old West Durham had it. 
          In the late 1800s, when the community was called Pinhook, railroad travelers 
          gathered on Hillsborough Road to sell tobacco and dabble in vices at 
          local brothels. A local newspaper described a typical scene one day 
          in 1871: A man and woman had run a foot race for a quart of liquor--stark 
          naked. When Erwin Cotton Mills started up at the turn of the century, 
          folks' behavior toned down as workers planted roots, building homes 
          and raising families. The "mill village of West Durham" became a residential 
          area where pastors, grocers and mill workers - black and white - lived 
          next door to one another. 
        <P> 
        <P>When Kelly Jarrett moved to Old West Durham from Connecticut in 1992, 
          the neighborhood still appeared to have its traditional flavor. Auto 
          mechanics and retired cotton mill workers lived alongside bankers and 
          teachers in small-frame houses with tidy flower beds. At nearby Duke 
          University, where Jarrett had accepted a part-time teaching post, giant 
          oak trees and concrete monuments bespoke the past, while new-age shops 
          and trendy restaurants flourished on Ninth Street. 
        <P> 
        <P>That eclectic mix attracted Jarrett to the area. But a couple of years 
          after she settled in, the glow began to wear off. That's when Betty 
          Greene, a former co-worker of Jarrett's from Connecticut who's African-American, 
          moved into Jarrett's Oakland Avenue duplex. 
        <P> 
        <P>"I used to sit out front and have conversations with neighbors," says 
          Jarrett, "but after Betty moved down, things slowly changed. We'd come 
          home from the grocery store and there'd be people on the porch talking. 
          Then we'd get out of the car, and suddenly conversations would stop." 
          Only later did Jarrett and Greene discover the source of the shushed 
          talk: Trouble was brewing on the block. 
        <P>

        <P><FONT SIZE=3><FONT SIZE=2><FONT COLOR=black><FONT SIZE=2>Jarrett and 
          Greene already knew about the three men living on their street who occasionally 
          shot off rifles at night, whooping it up just for fun. "Everybody knew 
          about their mentality," says Jarrett. "One night after I'd heard shots, 
          I asked a neighbor about it and they said, 'Oh, that's just Howard.'" 
          What the pair didn't know was that the men's antics would soon increase, 
          and become directed at them.<i> <br>

        <P>"I started to hear the 'N' word a lot coming from across the street," 
          says Greene. "Not enough to be confrontational, but enough to make sure 
          you'd hear. Then one day this guy rode by on a lawn mower and said the 
          word while talking to somebody near my driveway. On another occasion 
          I overheard him say, 'The only good nigger is a dead nigger.'" 
        <P> 
        <P>The "him" Greene refers to is Howard Snyder, one of the men who took 
          issue not just with Greene's race, but also with the fact that she and 
          Jarrett were housemates and, presumably, gay. "They absolutely made 
          that assumption," Jarrett says, "but that was their homophobia. We never 
          discussed our private lives, yet they felt they had the right to enforce 
          that assumption." During the summer of '95, gunshots in the middle of 
          the night became commonplace. The streetlight in front of Jarrett and 
          Greene's home was shot out three times. "We were afraid to turn the 
          lights on at night," Jarrett recalls, "because we could be seen." The 
          pair called the police, but were told that unless the rowdy bunch trespassed 
          or took direct action against them, they had little recourse. 
        <P> 
        <P>That changed after what Jarrett calls "the Sweet Jesus, White Power 
          night," when the trio went on a rampage, chanting "bitches, whores and 
          niggers out of West Durham." They marched up and down the block, shooting 
          rifles and shouting about "sweet Jesus" from loudspeakers. "When the 
          police arrived, they said they were having a dispute with 'those atheists,'" 
          recalls Greene. But they'd finally done enough for formal charges to 
          be filed. "It was clear this was race and gender bias," says Durham 
          District Attorney Frank Hardin. "The situation was extremely dangerous 
          and racially charged. I had lived here all my life and thought this 
          community had developed beyond that kind of activity, but with respect 
          to those three individuals, it harkened back to this country's dark 
          past." 
        <P> 
        <P>Hardin prosecuted the three men later that summer, winning convictions 
          on the charge of ethnic intimidation. None of the three served time, 
          but each was Þned and put on probation. 
        <P> 
        <P>More importantly, "Sweet Jesus, White Power night" had woken up the 
          neighborhood. The court had ordered the men to stay away from Jarrett 
          and Greene. Supportive neighbors from surrounding streets and nearby 
          areas like Watts-Hillandale helped enforce that order, implementing 
          street patrols and curbside escorts. "One guy," says Greene, "parked 
          his car outside our house and jogged home to make it look like someone 
          was here with us." Galvanized by this effort, a group of more than 50 
          citizens soon formed the Old West Durham Neighborhood Association. "The 
          first year we ran on adrenaline," says John Schelp, president of the 
          association. There was plenty of that to go around: While the convicted 
          men had stopped shooting guns and marching, they still tried to intimidate 
          people who came to Jarrett and Greene's aid. Visitors to their home 
          were frequently trailed when they left. And after he wrote a letter 
          to the Durham Herald-Sun decrying the men's behavior, Schelp "got lots 
          of hang-up calls and heard screeching tires go past my house." 
        <P> 
        <P>Things are quieter now. The three men have left the area; one is deceased. 
          But the neighborhood association hasn't lost steam. "It was important 
          to take all that energy and use it for something good," says Jarrett. 
          Over the past three years, the association has organized food drives 
          and gotten the city to install more streetlights in the neighborhood. 
          In October, a ceremony was held to unveil a new sign at the intersection 
          of Hillsborough Road and Ninth Street: "Old West Durham: Diversity, 
          Harmony, Community." Those three words have symbolically replaced the 
          three men who once wreaked such havoc for Jarrett, Greene and their 
          neighbors. 
        <P> 
        <P>"The most important thing was how they stood up to hate," says Wells 
          Eddleman, former chair of Durham's Human Relations Commission. On one 
          occasion, Eddleman sat in Jarrett and Greene's home "while the guns 
          were clicking and all that kind of stuff." Today, he says he's amazed 
          at the neighborhood's "courage and mutual support. Their slogan says 
          it all. It took a lot of work, particularly to bring the harmony." Chalk 
          it up as victory, relief, or both, but residents are reveling in a sense 
          of renewed pride. "In Old West Durham," says Schelp, "we've got a special 
          group of people who go sit on neighbors' porches and have a cup of coffee. 
          That's what these new neo-traditional villages are trying to attain, 
          but we've already got it." 
        <P> 
        <P>They've also got two new homeowners: Earlier this year, Kelly Jarrett 
          and Betty Greene purchased the Oakland Avenue duplex, putting down roots 
          in just the kind of neighborhood where they wanted to live all along.
