            driveways and parking lots with asphalt he buys from other 
            suppliers. About a year ago, the owner of Asphalt Experts decided to 
            open his own plant. But he couldn't find a place to build it, thanks 
            to a law that puts 1,500 feet between the smoky blue plumes of 
            asphalt plants and the places people live. So he did what other 
            Durham business people do when they need help building things. He 
            went to City Hall.

            Payne, then the city's economic development director, and members of 
            the city/county planning staff got together to work on Robins' 
            problem. After studying their laws and their maps, the staffers 
            suggested Robins request a change to the law to reduce the 1,500

            as it slid routinely through planning and zoning hearings last 
            summer. It squeaked through Durham's one environmental review board, 
            and the City Council planned to vote on it in September. 
            <P>But one citizen watchdog sounded an alarm after learning of the 
            proposal by accident. Days before the vote, neighborhood activist 
            and NAACP leader John Schelp roused enough outcry to convince the 
            council to delay the decision. Since then, Schelp has mobilized a 
            diverse coalition of neighborhood activists, civil rights advocates, 
            students and environmentalists. 
            <P>The proposal would create 10 new sites for potential asphalt 
            plants, which mix gravel, sand and rock with petroleum-based cement, 
            emitting pollutants such as benzene and formaldehyde. Of those, 
            eight are in East Durham, meaning less affluent, inner-city minority 
            communities would bear the brunt of unsightly, odorous and 
            potentially hazardous pollution from a smokestack industry feeding 
            growth in the wealthy white suburbs. 
            <P>A public debate is now raging over whether it's a good idea to 
            put asphalt plants within two football fields of houses. But until 
            Schelp rallied an unexpected but efficient revolt, the industry's 
            unimpeded progress toward its goal was business as usual in Durham's 
            planning process, where business interests influence the decisions 
            that shape the landscape and affect citizens' everyday lives. 
            <P>"Industry reps have insinuated themselves into every corner of 
            policy-making, with a deleterious effect for citizens," says Lou 
            Zeller, the research director and Clean Air Campaign organizer for 
            the Blue Ridge Environmental Defense League. His group battles 
            asphalt plants and other controversial industries all over the 
            state. "If the law is inconvenient for the industry to do business, 
            they change the law." 
            <P>Those who stand to profit from policy decisions have several 
            tactical advantages that begin long before residents have a chance 
            to speak at a public hearing. They originate on the ground floor of 
            City Hall, where the city/county planning staff jokes congenially 
            with developers who come in to study the wall maps and chat about 
            their plans. They continue upstairs, in the economic development 
            office, where the staff's mission includes helping local businesses 
            grow. 
            <P>Developers and business owners pay consultants to spend hours 
            lobbying and clearing the way for their plans--consultants who often 
            have long-standing relationships with staffers. They provide reams 
            of background information to the planning department, data that 
            often becomes the basis for staff recommendations in their favor. 
            <P>On the other side, citizens with less technical knowledge and 
            familiarity with the planning process rely on the public process to 
            alert them to what's happening in their neighborhoods. In the 
            asphalt case, the hearing notice was 10 words long, buried in a 
            page-long, inch-wide classified ad, and no letters went out to 
            neighborhood groups. 
            <P>And even when they do participate in the public process, 
            citizens--and their elected leaders--often find themselves at a 
            disadvantage, says County Commissioner Ellen Reckhow. 
            <P>"We are not experts on these topics. But the industries come in 
            with all this information and they can tell their side of the story 
            really well," says Reckhow, who chairs the Joint City-County 
            Planning Committee where the asphalt proposal first surfaced in 
            March. A planner by training, Reckhow calls the overall process 
            "lopsided." 
            <P>City and county staffers are quick to say their job is to serve 
            the entire public. Anyone can walk into the planning office, ask for 
            a change to the zoning law and launch the same approval process the 
            asphalt industry is now pursuing. Interim Planning Director Dick 
            Hails remembers an example from the 1980s, when a group of 
            neighborhood leaders sought to change the zoning of adjacent 
            properties to preserve open space near their homes. 
            <P>But most of the time, few people without a financial stake work 
            the system. 
            <P>"The person that's going to be the most aggressive, and is more 
            likely to spend the time in the planning office pushing projects, 
            are the people who are proposing development," says Mayor Bill Bell. 
            "And they have the time to do it, as opposed to John Q." 
            <P>In the asphalt case, the financial stakes are high: the N.C. 
            Department of Transportation awarded $1.2 billion in state road 
            contracts last year alone. David Rifenburg, of Rifenburg 
            Construction, who eventually joined Robins' effort to change the law 
            so he, too, could build a Durham asphalt plant, has won bids for 
            major road projects across the state. Rifenburg built the Martin 
            Luther King Jr. Parkway in Durham, a $7.6 million project, and two 
            years ago resurfaced the city's roads with 22,000 tons of asphalt 
            supplied by Carolina Sunrock Corporation. Carolina Sunrock, one of 
            the two existing asphalt plants in Durham, just won a bid to provide 
            asphalt to the city this year, a $147,028 contract. 
            <P>The Carolina Asphalt Pavement Association (CAPA), the industry 
            lobby in Raleigh, estimates that public road contracts make up only 
            about half the asphalt market. Private projects such as shopping 
            malls and housing developments make up the other half. Rifenburg's 
            private clients include Duke University (football stadium 
            improvements and hospital complex) and Beechwood subdivision in 
            Chapel Hill. 
            <P>Like other developers with profits at stake, both asphalt 
            companies hired consultants to help work the deal. Asphalt Experts 
            hired Durham attorney Will Anderson, and Rifenburg hired local land 
            planner George Stanziale. Stanziale's friendly relationship with the 
            Durham city/county planning staff dates back to 1984, when he 
            successfully advocated for controversial rezonings that led to the 
            development of tony Treyburn. 
            <P>"From my point of view, they always try to be helpful," Stanziale 
            says of the planning staff. "Their job is to protect and legislate 
            the [zoning] ordinance. But when someone wants to get something done 
            on a piece of property, and it doesn't meet the ordinance or a 
            particular plan, say, a small-area plan, they're going to always 
            work with us to see how we can get it done." 
            <P>Stanziale does frequent business with the planning department, 
            wearing several hats on behalf of his clients and his firm, 
            Haden-Stanziale. He represented developers of car dealerships as 
            part of the controversial Streets at Southpoint mall. He co-authored 
            the Downtown Master Plan and is often tapped to serve on advisory 
            committees, such as a 1998 group that recommended changes to 
            Durham's natural resources protections. And he profits from city 
            business, winning publicly funded contracts such as the $78,000 job 
            designing West Chapel Hill Street Park in 2000. He is currently 
            consulting on a rewrite of the city's development ordinance. 
            <P>Stanziale has never lost a Durham rezoning case. He says that's 
            partly because he chooses his projects carefully but also because he 
            has "great relationships" with the planning staff and involves them 
            early in his plans. 
            <P>Those relationships are one factor that contribute to citizens 
            feeling disenfranchised by the planning system, says one critic. 
            <P>"They've been doing this so long, some of them don't see how they 
            bend over backwards for the developers. Then they don't understand 
            why people like me think this is outrageous," says Steve Bocckino, a 
            citizen activist in southwest Durham who got involved in politics 
            when he led his neighborhood's battle against the Streets at 
            Southpoint mall at Fayetteville Road and Interstate 40. Bocckino now 
            serves on the planning commission, where he is frequently outraged 
            by staff recommendations that side with developers, often based on 
            what he calls "tortured logic." "They see the developers all the 
            time and the developers are their friends. And they see residents as 
            contentious naysayers." 
            <P>But while the planning staff plotted to help Doug Robins and 
            David Rifenburg move asphalt plants closer to homes, there weren't 
            any naysayers to contend with, because no one knew about the plan as 
            it gathered steam behind the scenes. 
            <P>After cooperating with the planning department to develop 
            language that was acceptable to both the staff and the industry, 
            Stanziale and Anderson took their proposal to the planning committee 
            for review in April. 
            <P>Zoning text amendments affect property across the county, rather 
            than altering the rules for one particular piece of land the way a 
            rezoning does. Text amendments also differ from rezonings in another 
            crucial way: They require very little public notice. If a resident 
            wants to change a house into an office, the city/county planning 
            department sends a letter to nearby neighbors, with details of the 
            request, an explanatory map, contact numbers for questions and dates 
            and places of public hearings. 
            <P>But if the asphalt industry--or anyone else--wants to amend the 
            law, the government puts an advertisement in the local newspaper, 
            back in the classified section, lumped in with a long list of other 
            issues described in technical language. 
            <P>In presenting the proposal to the planning committee, the 
            industry reps argued several key reasons for the change: The 
            1,500-foot setback rendered it impossible to build a new plant; 
            changes in asphalt technology and "tougher EPA air quality 
            standards" have cut down dust and noise affecting surrounding 
            properties; and "there is a need for more asphalt plants in Durham 
            to meet local needs." 
            <P>The planning staff backed them up, recommending approval based on 
            the applicants' arguments and a few of their own. One point staffers 
            cited was that the 1,500-foot setback had arisen out of a 1980s 
            rewrite of zoning laws in the wake of a chemical explosion and a 
            chemical fire in East Durham. During the revisions, asphalt plants 
            were lumped into the same category as hazardous materials and 
            explosives. 
            <P>"We looked at the actual impacts, and reported to the commission 
            that asphalt plants fall somewhere between concrete plants and 
            hazardous waste," says Hails. Concrete plants require only 100 feet 
            of buffer space, while hazardous waste facilities require the full 
            1,500 feet. 
            <P>The planning staff also mentioned that Raleigh, Greensboro and 
            Charlotte do not require any distance between asphalt plants and 
            homes, a point that struck Lou Zeller of the Blue Ridge 
            Environmental Defense League as ironic. 
            <P>"If Durham is even considering changing their setbacks, that's 
            just incredible to me," Zeller says. "They would be undoing a good 
            measure that protects public health in order to 'dumb-down' to what 
            other communities have." 
            <P>The citizen coalition has since pointed out several examples of 
            other cities, including Boston, that are expanding the buffers for 
            asphalt plants based on environmental and health concerns. 
            <P>Another reason the staff cited in its recommendation was Durham's 
            growth, saying "major road improvements and development projects 
            maintain a high demand, with much asphalt being trucked in."

            demanding it, we should take some responsibility for providing it," 
            says Hails. "If there's a demand for something in the community, 
            then you look at whether there's an appropriate site." 
            <P>The planning committee recommended approval, but also asked the 
            Environmental Affairs Board to review the plan before it went any 
            further. 
            <P>The EAB, a joint city-county advisory panel, is made up of local 
            residents with professional credentials in a variety of fields. 
            Elected officials created the board a decade ago to provide them 
            with expertise when faced with decisions just like this one. 
            <P>"The EAB is there because [Durham County Commissioner] Becky 
            Heron thought if we're giving the Chamber of Commerce money, we 
            should do something to balance the other side," says Bocckino. "It's 
            sort of the environmental chamber of commerce." 
            <P>The 11-member board has specific slots for individual disciplines 
            such as solid waste, water quality, air quality and public health, 
            with the city and county each appointing five members and one seat 
            for a representative of the Soil and Water Conservation District 
            Board. 
            <P>The EAB discussed the asphalt measure several times, eventually 
            voting 4-3 to approve it with some changes. The board recommended 
            expanding the setback from 600 feet to 750 feet, and requiring a 
            solid 8-foot perimeter wall. An eighth member who had to leave the 
            meeting early has indicated he would have voted against the plan, 
            meaning it narrowly missed a 4-4 tie. One of the points that swayed 
            the supporters was the staff's argument that Durham's setback was so 
            much larger than other North Carolina cities, says one EAB member, 
            who has since been chagrined to hear--via the citizen effort-- that 
            buffers in other states are much larger, and in some cases, 
            expanding. 
            <P>One of the three no votes was member Marian Johnson-Thompson, who 
            holds the EAB's public health seat. 
            <P>"It's a situation--again--where money and big business come in 
            and, I shouldn't say have no regard for poor people, but they're not 
            as sensitive as they should be," says Johnson-Thompson, whose 
            profession is studying health disparities among different 
            ethnicities. "As a member of the board, I was embarrassed about how 
            this vote went down." 
            <P>The EAB discussions focused primarily on noise and dust, despite 
            Johnson-Thompson's concerns that the health and quality of life for 
            Durham's less affluent communities of color were the real target. 
            The industry reps produced a voluminous stack of supporting 
            paperwork, including a report arguing that asphalt plant emissions 
            were no more dangerous than those of an average bakery. 
            <P>"We did a lot of homework for them," says Stanziale. "We felt 
            like we answered all of their questions." 
            <P>With approval from the planning committee and the EAB, the 
            proposal went next to a public hearing at the zoning committee. 
            <P>John Schelp was sitting in the City Council chambers that night, 
            waiting for his turn to speak. As the president of the Old West 
            Durham Neighborhood Association, Schelp was there to urge the zoning 
            committee to require more open space in "mixed-use" developments. 
            <P>When the asphalt industry representatives stepped forward, Schelp 
            listened in disbelief as they outlined their proposal. 
            <P>The industry reps repeated their arguments: the lack of eligible 
            land under the current zoning law and the growing market demand for 
            asphalt in Durham. They said recent technological advancements 
            reduce the environmental impact and health hazards. Missing from the 
            discussion, Schelp says, was any recognition that the residents most 
            likely to be subjected to new asphalt plants within 600 feet of 
            their houses were low-income minorities. 
            <P>"I thought to myself, we can debate health effects all night, but 
            the asphalt industry says they are only interested in the sites in 
            East Durham," says Schelp. "There's no gray area there." 
            <P>It was clear to him the proposal had coasted pretty far toward 
            City Council approval with zero public debate, thanks in part to a 
            10-word-long public hearing notice "the size of a blade of grass." 
            <P>"The asphalt industry had eight months to whisper 'facts' into 
            the ears of officials while the neighborhoods sat in the dark," 
            Schelp says. 
            <P>Shocked by the environmental justice issue going unchallenged, 
            and the one-sided nature of the discussion, Schelp began collecting 
            a citizen coalition to shine a public spotlight on the plan. 
            <P>He started with his position within the Durham NAACP. The only 
            white member of its executive committee, Schelp had been working to 
            build racial bridges for months. A former Peace Corps worker with a 
            master's degree in public administration, six years in the Congo and 
            a long record of neighborhood activism, Schelp had recently been 
            asked to organize the NAACP's "community committee" to bring diverse 
            Durhamites together to work on common initiatives. The five-member 
            group agreed to take on the asphalt project, and the NAACP advanced 
            the committee $50 for publicity. 
            <P>When the measure was scheduled for a Sept. 16 vote before the 
            City Council, Schelp mobilized letter-writers through an e-mail 
            list-serv that began with the five people on his community 
            committee. It now contains 300 members. 
            <P>Schelp, two other NAACP leaders and the minister of Morehead 
            Avenue Baptist Church co-authored a letter to the editor published 
            in <I>The Herald-Sun </I>on Sept. 16, the day before the scheduled 
            vote. 
            <P>"It's bad enough that developers are forcing limited local 
            resources to be shifted from less affluent in-town neighborhoods to 
            newly-paved suburban developments," they wrote. "Must we now face 
            the threat of hazardous exposures from the asphalt industry?" 
            <P>Council members, beginning to receive protest e-mails and facing 
            voters in an election just six weeks away, voted unanimously to 
            table the proposal. 
            <P>"No one was real excited about this issue once it turned into a 
            hot potato," says Anderson, the attorney for Asphalt Experts. 
            <P>The neophyte coalition celebrated the delayed vote and began in 
            earnest to outline their next attack. They targeted three issues: 
            the lack of public notice, the potential health hazards, and the 
            disproportionate effect on low-income minority neighborhoods. 
            <P>Neighborhood associations across the county and churches in East 
            Durham began to spread the word through their memberships. Schelp 
            called Duke University officials to alert them their rare books 
            storage is next door to one of the potential asphalt plant sites. He 
            asked the Eno River Association to look at water quality issues, 
            since one of the potential sites sits along the Eno. 
            <P>Local environmentalists compiled data about the effects of 
            asphalt plant pollution, including the dangers of toxic emissions 
            from benzene and other byproducts of hot asphalt mixing. Prompted by 
            the protesters, leaders of Environmental Defense, a national 
            advocacy group, wrote a letter to the mayor and city manager citing 
            Durham's ranking among the "dirtiest counties" in the United States 
            based on an average individual's added cancer risk from air 
            pollution. In a letter signed by Director Jane Preyer, the group 
            urged the council to kill the measure, saying more asphalt plants in 
            Durham would raise the county's already dangerous levels of 
            acrolein, a chemical emitted by asphalt plants. 
            <P>According to the federal Occupational Safety and Health 
            Administration, exposure to asphalt fumes can cause headaches, skin 
            rashes, fatigue, reduced appetite, throat and eye irritation, and 
            coughing. Asphalt paving workers, for example, have reported 
            breathing problems, asthma, bronchitis, and skin irritation, 
            according to OSHA, and studies have reported lung, stomach, and skin 
            cancers following chronic exposures to asphalt fumes. 
            <P>N.C. Central University professor Yolanda Anderson lent the group 
            an intern and the campus student group, Central Environmental Action 
            Student Effort (CEASE) got involved. CEASE printed a fact sheet and 
            launched a public education campaign to spread the word to residents 
            in the predominantly black neighborhoods around campus, where four 
            of the potential sites lie. As they walked door-to-door, nine out of 
            10 residents they talked to had no idea they were living adjacent to 
            a potential asphalt factory, with its burning petroleum smell and 
            dump trucks trailing fumes down the street, says intern Melissa 
            Lewis. 
            <P>One Morehead Hills resident on the e-mail list eventually sent 
            Schelp a $50 check, saying he was glad to double the group's budget. 

            <P>When the industry reps said publicly they were seeking 
            "independent data" from the state Division of Air Quality to 
            counteract their critics, Schelp asked DAQ Director Alan Klimek to 
            address the citizens' concerns as well. In a stock response the DAQ 
            has given in similar controversies across the state, Klimek replied 
            that the location of new asphalt plants is strictly "a local issue." 
            Klimek wrote an op-ed piece last year echoing the same sentiments. 
            CAPA, the industry lobby group, likes Klimek's argument so much it 
            now includes his essay in the organization's public information 
            packet.

            more ingrained at the state level than it is locally, says Zeller, 
            who attends DAQ advisory committee meetings where "The environmental 
            groups don't show up but the industry shows up in droves." 
            <P>In Durham, as letters from across town poured in to newspapers 
            and City Hall, the local industry reps turned to their state 
            association for backup. CAPA Executive Director Christie Barbee shot 
            back at critics, writing a letter to local newspapers countering 
            Schelp's first attack. She called the environmental injustice issue 
            "baseless" and touted the industry's safety record and Durham's need 
            for asphalt. 
            <P>"I got a copy of [Schelp's] letter and there was a lot of 
            misinformation about our industry," says Barbee. "No one in our 
            industry strives to be controversial or to stir up trouble. But as 
            city limits grow, you've got more and more area that needs 
            pavement." 
            <P>Having only two plants in Durham raises the cost of asphalt, says 
            Barbee, citing cheaper prices in areas like Charlotte-Mecklenburg, 
            where there are more than a dozen plants. "Durham is a good market," 
            she says. "And Durham certainly could use the jobs that a plant 
            would bring." 
            <P>Asked how many employees a plant needs, Barbee estimated "six to 
            eight," but added that the plants also generate related jobs for 
            truck drivers and pavement workers. 
            <P>As the grassroots organizers mounted their campaign, it was the 
            accusations of environmental injustice that surprised the city 
            staffers the most, including the interim planning director. 
            <P>"I've heard of it in other places, but it's new for here," Hails 
            says. 
            <P>Actually, environmental justice issues in East Durham date back 
            to the 1980s. A chemical company called Armageddon Recycling Co. on 
            Peabody Street was cited repeatedly for leaking barrels that 
            eventually exploded on March 10, 1983. A community group that formed 
            to protest, Citizens for a Safer East Durham, pointed out in its 
            flyers that the situation wouldn't have dragged on so long if the 
            plant were "on the other side of town." Another chemical plant in 
            the same vicinity, SouthChem Inc. on East Pettigrew Street, was the 
            scene of a massive chemical fire on Sept. 3, 1986. Today, SouthChem 
            is still in business and ranks as Durham County's third-largest 
            polluter, according to Environmental Defense. 
            <P>Overall, Durham's minority residents are four times more likely 
            than whites to live near facilities emitting air pollutants, 
            according to the Environmental Defense scorecard, while families 
            below poverty are also four times more likely to live near polluting 
            facilities than those above poverty. 
            <P>"If you're poor and black, that's what you get," says Schelp. 
            <P>The future of the asphalt proposal may be decided within the 
            month. The Joint City/County Planning Committee discussed it again 
            on Feb. 6 and asked for more input from the Environmental Affairs 
            Board. This time around, the industry may have even one more vote, 
            thanks to another behind-the-scenes move. On Oct. 15, the City 
            Council appointed Asphalt Experts attorney Will Anderson to the 
            attorney slot on the EAB. Anderson replaced outgoing member Jim 
            Conner, an environmental activist and lawyer. 
            <P>The council has scheduled a discussion for Feb. 21. Whether the 
            plan will then be scheduled for a March 4 vote depends on the 
            council, says City Manager Marcia Conner, while complaining about 
            how much time her staff has had to spend responding to the 
            "overwhelming number of e-mails." 
            <P>Mayor Bell, whose inbox has also been flooded with protests, 
            predicts the grassroots effort has accomplished its mission. 
            <P>"I don't think this has a chance of going anywhere," he says. 
            "Let me put it this way, I haven't had anybody write me saying we 
            ought to be supporting this." 
            <P>If they succeed in changing the zoning law, Asphalt Experts and 
            Rifenburg Construction may build a plant together, according to 
            Stanziale. 
            <P>Schelp and his coalition want the setbacks for asphalt plants to 
            stay at 1,500 feet. They want the planning staff to learn about 
            environmental justice issues. And they want the rules for public 
            notice of text amendments rewritten so they trigger letters to 
            affected neighbors like rezonings do. On the last point, they 
            already have support from the mayor. 
            <P>"Given the amount of attention that's been given to that issue, I 
            think the staff will look at a little different process," Bell says, 
            though the staff is not so sure. Assistant planning director Bonnie 
            Estes says with text amendments, "It's difficult to know who's 
            impacted, so it would be difficult to know who to notify." 
            <P>Bocckino and a fellow planning commission member have proposed 
            another system reform: a new ethics policy requiring planning staff 
            and commission members to disclose their personal financial 
            interests. 
            <P>County Commissioner Reckhow supports improvements to the public 
            notice process and the ethics proposal. But in the bigger picture, 
            she wants the government to balance the interests of people who live 
            here and the people who profit. 
            <P>"We recognize there's a gap and we're looking for ways to level 
            the playing field," she says. "We need to do a much better job 
            empowering our citizens." <IMG alt=EndBlock
