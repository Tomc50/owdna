            (WRAL)</strong> -- Cookouts and swapping stories on the front porch 
            -- it is the way many of us keep up with the latest neighborhood news. 
            Others catch up through newsletters. Now, communities have found a 
            new way to stay connected. </font> 
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The Old West 
              Durham neighborhood is rich in history. Neighbors are building a 
              new community on the World Wide Web. </font>
            <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It helps communicate 
              more visually than we could by telling them," says Pam Spaulding. 
              </font>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The neighborhood 
              association went high-tech about two years ago. It is up to Spaulding 
              to make sure her neighbors are wired to the latest community news. 
              </font>
            <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"People now 
              see there's an identity," says Spaulding. She says the site is a 
              way to get news out quickly and it offers valuable information. 
              </font>
            <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"What it can 
              do is provide resources -- city resources -- how to contact animal 
              control, the police, the fire department," she says. </font>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The site is 
              used to announce neighborhood meetings and yard sales. It is also 
              a very modern way of preserving history. </font>
            <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Why were these 
              homes built and who were these people? I think the Web site helps 
              you know that." </font>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Kathleen Graves 
              has learned a lot about her neighborhood and her neighbors through 
              the Internet. </font>
            <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It's given 
              a sense of pride in the community. [When] we have a neighborhood 
              cleanup, Pam always gets pictures and puts them on the Web site," 
              says Graves. </font>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The neighborhood 
              Web site cannot replace the front porch and getting to know your 
              neighbors face to face, but it can add another dimension to the 
              community. </font>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> On Tuesday, 
              the Old West Durham neighborhood will be recognized as a local legacy 
              at the Library of Congress in Washington D.C. Its entry was compiled 
              from information on its Web site. </font>
