          70 locations across North America... and beyond. In October, 2004, <font size="2">Old

        <p>Durham took quite a few hits when the tobacco economy crumbled. Now, 
          in anticipation of a 2007 light rail connection that will connect Durham 
          with Raleigh and Research Triangle Park, sleepy and sad areas of the 
          central core are beginning to perk up.</p>
        <p>We're particularly impressed by the way in which the developers have 
          worked sensibly with the established Old West Durham Neighborhood Association. 
          Neighbors, in turn, have supported neighbor-friendly development in 
          the nearby Ninth Street District.</p>
        <p>The district, in particular, has seen an influx of energy and people 
          thanks in large part to Station Nine, a 323-unit apartment complex located 
          on the site of the former cotton mill. Now open.</p>

          Is Duke trying to isolate itself? </strong><br>
          <font color="black" size="2">(Herald-Sun,15 March 2004)</font></font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Over the past year, the Duke-Durham partnership neighborhoods 
          have met dozens of times with Duke officials. We've devoted hundreds 
          of hours to Duke's campus rezoning and Central Campus plans.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">We supported the rezoning for the Medical Center, East 
          Campus and West Campus. We support the re-development of Central Campus. 
          We support all the new dorms. We support the new restaurants and the 
          performing arts center. We support the 99-room hotel, bowling alley,<br>
          Duke clothing store and on-campus book store with coffee shop.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">We have been quite reasonable in supporting Duke's needs. 
          Retail use supporting the university mission is appropriate. But we 
          voted to oppose retail on Central Campus which is above and beyond the 
          school's academic mission.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">We're troubled on-campus retail would have an unfair 
          advantage over nearby businesses because they wouldn't have to pay property 
          taxes. Were troubled the on-campus retail would undermine surrounding<br>
          neighborhoods and also create an on-campus retail cocoon -- further 
          isolating Duke students from Durham.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">We are opposed to any on-campus retail beyond the agreement 
          we worked out with Duke Executive Vice President Tallman Trask (i.e. 
          three restaurants to serve the new student dorms, a bowling alley, maybe 
          a<br>
          performing arts center, 99-room hotel, Duke clothing store, on-campus 
          book store with coffee shop). That's it, no more retail. The partnership 
          neighborhoods then voted on and endorsed this agreement.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">At Wednesday's meeting, Duke showed plenty of &quot;conceptual&quot; 
          drawings, but proved evasive with specific retail figures -- not committing 
          to anything.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">When pressed, Mr. Trask acknowledged Duke was seeking 
          an additional 10,000 square feet of retail (or five shops). And, he 
          acknowledged it might be more. This extra retail is a violation of the 
          retail agreement worked out with the partnership neighborhoods zoned 
          under the &quot;university&quot; category but raised the possibility 
          it might be &quot;general commercial.&quot; Going<br>
          with general commercial is consistent with Duke's actions a year ago, 
          when the university architect went behind our back to actively lobby 
          for removal of the term &quot;limited retail&quot; from Durham's university 
          ordinance. That Duke would even consider zoning part of its campus as 
          general commercial is stunning news.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Duke recently decided to lower its parking lot gates 
          during off-hours. The University just built an eight-foot fence along 
          sections of its southern<br>
          boundary.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Last year, Duke officials privately insisted on being 
          able to build a future eight-foot fence and gates with card readers 
          around East Campus if they wanted to. Now, one of Duke's most senior 
          officials has stated a<br>
          desire to build even more on-campus retail.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">This troubling pattern raises a serious question. Is 
          Duke trying to isolate itself from Durham?<br>

          We are very excited about the planned renovation of this block of Ninth 
          Street which has stood vacant for too long. We are absolutely delighted 
          that the new buildings will serve as a bridge between the Ninth Street

          the City, a four-way stop sign was placed at Georgia and Englewood. 
          This measure was deemed more desirable by OWDNA than blocking off Georgia 
          -- which would have resulted in higher traffic levels in Old West Durham. 
          Finally, responding to resident concerns about pedestrian safety near 
          the ABC store, OWDNA succeeded in getting the City to install a four-way 
          stop sign at the corner of West Knox and Alabama. </font></font><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
