                D. Loudermilk</a>, the Grammy Award winning Country &amp; Western 
                composer, grew up in this house on Dezern Place (near Hale Street). 
                Loudermilk is perhaps best known as the composer of "Tobacco Road" 
                -- a stark, stomping tale of hard-bitten Southern poverty with 
                a strong blues flavor sung by Lou Rawls, Jefferson Airplane, Edgar 
                Winter, and others. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">This song 
                was far from Loudermilk's only success. In the late 1950s and 
                early 1960s, he supplied material for country stars, teen idols, 
                and rock singers, including "Waterloo" (Stonewall Jackson), "Angela 
                Jones" (Johnny Ferguson), "Ebony Eyes" (Everly Brothers), "Norman" 
                (Sue Thompson), "Abilene" (George Hamilton IV), "What Made Milwaukee 
                Famous Has Made a Loser Out of Me" (Loudermilk), and "This Little 
                Bird" (Marianne Faithfull's moody British hit).</font></p>            </td>

            If you don't, you will have congestion<br>
            And your life it will be a wreck.<br>
            &nbsp;<br>
            And let your streets be narrow.<br>
            In the neighborhood cars could slow.<br>

            The people they will be happy,<br>

            Oh don't be afraid of density.<br>
            It will bring your cities life.<br>
