        <p><font color="Green">The questions now are simple: 1) Do all plans proposed by Duke support the academic mission of the university? 2) Are Duke's plans designed to serve the on-campus population of the university and not to attract additional traffic to the campus?</font></p>
        <p><font color="Green">We will continue to keep a watchful eye on Duke's Central Campus plans and will work with officials to ensure that campus retail operations don't hold an unfair advantage by not having to pay property taxes - thereby undermining nearby businesses that do have to pay taxes.<br>

           Duke's Office of Community Affairs, spent much of the evening offering

           impact Central Campus changes could have on Durham. Some community
          members 
          fear that a lavishly appointed Central Campus will create a cocoon
          for  Duke students, giving them little reason to spend their money

           Association and a Duke employee, compared the school's refusal to
          eliminate 
          the possibility of mass-market commercial development to the behavior
           of a 700-pound gorilla...</p>
        <p>Duke has formed four committees charged with examining various aspects
           of Central Campus development such as housing and dining, academic
          programs 
          and spaces, and community affairs. None of the committees includes
          Durham  residents free of educational or financial ties to the university.<br>

               with their lack of information and input about the University's
              plans 
            for developing Central. They are concerned that in its zeal to make
               Central Campus an appealing student destination, the University
              will 
            overdevelop the retail offerings and overstep the bounds of its educational

        <p><font size="3">This stretch of Ninth Street and the surrounding area
               just a few blocks from Duke University's East Campus has long been
              an 
            off-campus outlet where Duke students and local residents socialize
               while supporting a business district that is an integral part of
              Old 
            West Durham... Duke says it simply wants to serve its students better.
               But some merchants suspect that the university is pursuing a strategy
              
          to keep more student dollars on the campus while providing retail options
               that would also appeal to local residents... The tension recalls
              the 
            days when Duke's neighbors and others in the city saw the university
               as an isolated, arrogant, and sometimes clumsy behemoth that had
              little 
            outward regard for local folk. </font></p>

              my business 
          to Ninth Street ... because it's the last place in Durham where you
               can walk up and down the street, window-shop, and chat with your

          and experience town life.&quot;</font></em><font color="Navy"><br>

              Duke. 
            In return, the proposed Central Campus plans will establish serious,
               property-tax free competition to the business districts of Ninth
              Street, 
            Brightleaf Square and Main Street. This unfair advantage for Duke,
              if  allowed by City Council, would be even more outrageous than the
              contradictory 
            statements and false promises Duke's neighbors have come to expect.
               No matter what university officials want us to believe, what's good
              
          for Duke is not always good for Durham. </font></p>

               if Duke is going to compete with local businesses above and beyond
              the 
            scope of its educational mission, then it ought to pay its fair share
               like everyone else. But whether or not they should pay taxes, it's
              clear 
            that the fact they don't pay any has a big effect on the tax bill of
               those of us who do. What would Durham's budget be like -- meaning,
              how 
            low would taxes be, or how big a surplus would we have if the biggest
               landowner and employer in the county paid taxes like other companies?</font></p>

        <p><font size="3">Durham's neighborhood associations and merchants have
               worked hard to accommodate Duke's needs and wishes. We support much
              
          of what Duke wants to do, vis-a-vis rezoning and redevelopment, new
               dorms, and many of the stores and buildings that have logical relationships
              
          to Duke's needs (performing arts, hotel, bookstore, and other college-related
               retail)... But we won't support a campus turned into a strip mall
              filled 
            with property tax-exempt stores. What is Duke's mission? To educate
               students or to Wal-martize Central Campus?</font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><strong>Duke 'closing itself off'?</strong><br>
          (Herald-Sun, 3 April 2004)</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Many of the panelists who convened to talk about the
               security measures that Duke University instituted after four armed
              robberies 
            on or near campus last fall criticized the university Friday for walling
               itself off from the community.</font> </p>
        <p><font size="3">Duke's security measures have drawn the ire of folks
               like graduate student Simon Hay, who argued in an e-mail, signed
              by 
            60 other graduate students, undergraduates and professors, that Duke
               was closing itself off from the community in the name of security. &quot;At
                Duke, language of security means control of resources, where Duke
               wants 
            to keep students out of Durham and keep their money on Duke's campus,&quot; Hay
            said from the audience Friday. </font></p>

        <p><font size="3">The Old West Durham Neighborhood Association seems
              at  the end of its patience with Duke University over development
              issues, 
            and that's too bad for both parties. Old West Durham president John
               Schelp said last week Duke is more interested in what it wants to
              do 
            than in fostering a true partnership with adjacent neighborhoods...
               Duke has raised justifiable ire within the Old West Durham group
              with 
            its plans for rebuilding Central Campus, including more space for retail
               than Old West Durham says it agreed to. Schelp and others fear that
              
          too much tax-exempt retail in Central Campus would affect Ninth Street,
               Brightleaf Square and even Northgate Mall. These are legitimate
              concerns... 
            Duke for its part needs to compromise with Old West Durham to the fullest
               extent possible, and win back the neighborhood's trust. </font></p>

        <p><font size="3">Donna Lisker, director of Duke's Women's Center, stressed
               that trying to keep people off campus wouldn't prevent most of the
              sexual 
            assaults on Duke students. The Women's Center receives about 40 reports
               of sexual assault each year, she said, and generally only one report
              
          involves an attack from a stranger. Although trying to prevent stranger
               rape is important, Lisker said, women students should not ignore
              the 
            greater risk they actually face.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Prof. Lubiano said she understands what it's like to
               feel vulnerable: She is a rape survivor, her brother was killed
              in a 
            liquor-store robbery and her sister-in-law worked in the part of the
               Pentagon attacked on September 11. Despite this, she said, she doesn't
              
          believe in trying to separate Duke from the community in the name of
               security.</font></p>

          (Chronicle, 2 April 2004)</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Duke's neighbors said the University was slowly pulling
               into its own bubble, isolating itself from the city it calls home. &quot;It
                appears from the outside that Duke has very much a fortress mentality
               
          and that they don't want to be associated with Durham,&quot; said Elizabeth
             Dondero, president of the Burch Avenue Neighborhood Association.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">&quot;Duke is from all accounts trying to set up a
              retail  cocoon for students and faculty and staff,&quot; said John
              Schelp, president  of the Old West Durham Neighborhood Association...
              David Smith, president 
            of the Trinity Park Neighborhood Association, said he has also heard
               concerns that Central Campus plans will allow Duke to become a
              community
          in itself, rather than remaining a part of the larger Durham community.</font></p>

        <p><font size="3">Duke University administrators spelled out long-range
               plans for the redevelopment of Central Campus at a neighborhood
              meeting 
            Wednesday, repeating one message over and over: Duke doesn't want to
               hurt businesses on Ninth Street or other commercial districts. But
              many 
            of the merchants in Duke's formidable shadow were not convinced, after
               looking at 50-year plans for a hotel, auditorium, restaurants, offices,
              
          shops and new housing in the 200-acre wedge between East and West campuses.

               Skip Anderson, owner of the Zola Craft Gallery on Ninth Street.
              He thought 
            the new Central Campus would further isolate Duke students and visitors
               from the rest of the town. &quot;It's a mental wall created by Duke,
                by providing for every single student need on campus,&quot; he
                said.</font>        </p>

        <p><font size="3">On-campus retail would have an impact on the business
               districts surrounding Duke. Vacant storefronts along West Chapel
              Hill 
            Street in the West End, Brightleaf Square, downtown and Ninth Street
               would harm the very neighborhoods Duke is trying to help. Also,
              existing 
            small businesses would be at a disadvantage because Duke's on-campus
               retail shops wouldn't have to pay property taxes. Finally, creating
              
          an on-campus retail cocoon would further isolate Duke students from
               Durham... So Duke faces a decision. Will it violate its agreement
              with 
            the partnership neighborhoods? Will it exceed its academic mission
              and  pursue on-campus retail that would harm small businesses in
              Durham? 
            The ball is in Duke's court. </font></p>

               to go before

          Duke's two-story apartments complex on Central Campus with a development
               that might include a limited number of retail shops. Initially the
              university 
            asked for the ordinance to allow unlimited retail uses that would not
               be restricted to students. After Old West Durham and Watts-Hillandale

          The Independent Weekly, December 15, 2004</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Lured by dollar signs, senior officials at Duke University
               have been talking about rezoning the university's Central Campus
              in 
            a way that goes beyond the academic mission of the university. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Since February 2003, the Duke-Durham Partnership neighborhoods
               have worked hard to support rezonings for Duke's Medical Center,
              East 
            Campus and West Campus. Leaders of the neighborhoods around Duke supported
               the redevelopment of Central Campus, an area between West Campus
              and 
            the medical center. We worked out with senior Duke officials a list
               of retail uses we felt would be compatible with the neighborhoods--including
              
          three new restaurants, a performing arts center, a 99-room hotel, a
               bowling alley, a Duke clothing store, new dorms and an on-campus
              book 
            store with coffee shop. The partnership neighborhoods then voted to
               support this agreement. The list has remained unchanged ever since.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Duke then asked the partnership neighborhoods to acquiesce
               on looming construction projects, such as an eye center, an addition
              
          to Perkins library and new East Campus dorms. We did.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">We feel we've been quite reasonable in supporting Duke's
               needs. In response, Duke has been less than neighborly.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Retail use supporting the academic mission of the university,
               such as student restaurants or a campus bookstore, is appropriate.
              But 
            the partnership neighborhoods voted to oppose retail on Central Campus
               that goes beyond academic retail, such as general clothing or jewelry
              
          stores. This sort of retail would have an unfair advantage over nearby
               businesses because they wouldn't have to pay property taxes and
              would 
            undermine the surrounding community.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Duke, however, hasn't been working in good faith with
               the community. At a March 10 forum in Trinity Heights, Duke officials
              
          acknowledged they're looking at more retail than the list we had worked
               out.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Duke's intentions were confirmed when Duke executive
               vice president Tallman Trask III said at the forum that Duke might
              ask 
            that Central Campus be zoned &quot;general commercial&quot; by the
            city.  A general commercial designation, which would allow unlimited
            retail, 
            would be consistent with Duke's actions a year ago, when the university
             architect went behind the partnership neighborhoods' backs to actively
            
          lobby the city's planning department to remove the term &quot;limited
             retail&quot; from Durham's University-College ordinance.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">For months, university officials have refused to share
               details of their retail plans with the community. Why the secrecy?
              Instead, 
            Duke accused the neighborhood partners of spreading rumors that Duke
               wanted to build more retail. Lo and behold, it appears we were right.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Bowing to community pressure, Duke is now saying it
               might offset the loss of property taxes by working out some sort
              of 
            payment. Why create a special status for Duke retail? Why not just
              pay  property taxes like all other Durham businesses? Why is Duke
              trying 
            to deny local jurisdictions revenue?</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Creating an on-campus retail cocoon would exacerbate
               the town-gown tensions that prompted the creation of the Duke-Durham
              
          partnership initiative, further isolating Duke students from Durham
               by discouraging students from patronizing off-campus businesses.
              A self-contained 
            retail center at Central Campus would transform the Durham Freeway
              into  a physical barrier between Duke's main campus and the bustling
              commercial 
            strip on Ninth Street. Why venture out to Ninth Street, Brightleaf
              Square  or Northgate Mall when you can shop right on campus?</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">A graduate student recently said at a campus forum
              that &quot;security&quot; at Duke means control of resources--keeping
              students out of Durham and their money on Duke's campus. The university
              has
            now 
            lowered its parking lot gates during off-hours and closed campus
              streets. The inconvenience and expense of parking at Duke sends
              a message that
            
          outsiders, such as Durham residents, are less welcome.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Reinforcing this message, Duke recently erected an
              eight-foot  fence and gates along sections of its southern boundary
              in order to, 
            they say, protect parked cars. And a 45-year-old woman walking her
              dog  on East Campus was recently stopped by a Duke police officer
              who asked 
            her: &quot;How long do you intend to be on campus?&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">All the while, Duke officials insist they have no intention
               of isolating the campus.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">With Duke, don't listen to what they say, look at what
               they do. Throughout the retail discussions, Duke repeatedly claimed
              
          they care deeply about the Durham community. Yet, Duke got out of $596,000
               in impact fees for their new construction and paid $847,000 less
              than 
            requested to help Durham cover local costs (figures represent what
              the  city said Duke should pay minus what Duke eventually paid).
              At the same 
            time, Duke had no problem finding $500,000 to buy iPods for all incoming
               students.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Duke contributes far less than Princeton, Harvard and
               Brown universities pay to their host cities. This money could have
              funded 
            important projects in our community.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">And while Duke says that all this new campus construction
               won't have an impact on local traffic because it'll be offset by
              regional 
            rail, Duke repeatedly resisted a regional rail station at Duke Medical
               Center.</font></p>
        <p>T<font size="3">heir wish came true when the Triangle Transit Authority
             recently announced that the medical center station had been dropped
            
          from its plans for this stage. Since Duke is Durham's largest employer,
             including thousands at the medical center, the station could have
            helped 
          keep cars off area streets.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">With the loss of the TTA rail station at the medical
               center, Duke's excuse for paying less to the city is no longer valid.
              
          So, Duke's check to help cover the local costs associated with its

        <p><font size="3">Despite assurances by Duke officials at the March forum
               that they'd try to better communicate their Central Campus plans
              with 
            the neighborhoods, we've heard nothing from Duke for nine months. We
               then read on Nov. 29 in The Chronicle, the student newspaper, that
              Duke's 
            Board of Trustees was set to approve proposals for Central Campus.
              Duke  officials say the article was wrong.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Duke could have set the record straight. One thing
              this  episode shows is that Duke doesn't yet get that they need to
              be proactive 
            in contacting and sharing information with its partnership neighborhoods.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Since the March meeting, Duke officials have started
               inviting new presidents of partnership neighborhoods to meetings.
              The 
            exclusion from this meeting of those with whom Duke had been negotiating
               Central Campus plans for months raised suspicions that Duke was
              trying 
            to foster divisions between the partnership neighborhoods they say
              they  want to help.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">There is good news. The Chronicle of Higher Education
               recently wrote an excellent <a href="http://chronicle.com/temp/reprint.php?id=19bb8nm6a4amlf6nwpy8g52tliza0bc1">article</a> describing
               Duke's retail efforts. The Herald-Sun wrote an editorial saying
               Duke has raised &quot;justifiable ire&quot; with its plans
             for  Central Campus and needs to win back the neighborhoods' trust.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">And, after months of discussions, the InterNeighborhood
               Council of Durham, a group that links neighborhood associations
              from 
            across the city, voted this summer to support the position that the
               new University-College District is the most appropriate zoning designation
              
          for Duke's Central Campus. The INC also supported the list of limited
               retail uses that was worked out with Duke and endorsed by the partnership
              
          neighborhoods in 2003.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Just before the vote, Michael Palmer, Duke's director
               of community affairs, tried to have the sentence supporting the
              retail 
            list removed from the position statement. He failed, and the measure
               was passed. Despite Duke's effort to manipulate the INC's decision,
              
          the vote wasn't even close.</font></p>

        <p align="center"><font size="3">The INC vote represents a setback for
               Duke's efforts to build on-campus retail that goes beyond the academic
              
          mission of the university. We know the City Council is paying attention.
               We hope Duke's Board of Trustees is, too.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">This year, Duke welcomed a new president, marking a
               new beginning. Hopefully, Dr. Richard Brodhead will use this opportunity
              
          to clear the deck. Fulfilling two simple requests would help move things
               in the right direction:</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">* Have Duke stick to the list of on-campus retail uses
               the partnership neighborhoods worked out with the university and
              later 
            was supported by the InterNeighborhood Council.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">* Move the Neighborhood Partnership Initiative out
              of  the Public Affairs office (more concerned about Duke's image
              than finding 
            real solutions to problems) and into an area of the president's office
               with more substance. Then, maybe we can bring the word &quot;partnership&quot; back
               into the mix.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">And maybe we can clear the air and move forward. Then,
               maybe Duke can go back to focusing on academics and not undermine
              Durham 
            with its on-campus retail schemes.</font></p>

              does  retain<br>
          the language I showed the neighborhoods and Duke. Duke<br>
          is actively lobbying to change it. They want to change<br>
          the next to last sentence of the permitted uses<br>
          section to read:<br>
&quot;Retail uses, such as university-related bookstores<br>
          and dining facilities located within other buildings,<br>
          shall be permitted, to the extent that they are<br>

          university and not to attract additional traffic to<br>
          the campus.&quot;<br>
          This proposes to delete the qualifiers of 'limited'<br>
          retail and 'on-campus population.' The effect of these<br>
          changes would be that any retail designed to serve a<br>
          population between the ages of 18 and 65 would be a<br>
          permitted use.<br>
          In effect, Duke is requesting the language be changed<br>
          to permit a Streets of Southpoint as a permitted use<br>

             and started using the term &quot;Mixed Use&quot; instead. While &quot;Mixed
              Use&quot; makes for better for public consumption, it's still a zoning
