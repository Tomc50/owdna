        <p>By John W. Olive, Wilmington, NC 
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the old days, 
          fires were much more likely to occur than now. Back then, there were 
          no smoke alarms or sprinkler systems. There was no 911 emergency telephone 
          number. Many families who had modest incomes did not have a telephone. 
          </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">For this reason, 
          red fire alarm boxes were mounted on light poles in almost every block. 
          When the small lever on the front of the box was pulled down, it would 
          send a signal to the Fire Department where a big board on the wall would 
          light up, showing the location of the signal box, and the fire trucks 
          would be on their way. Pranksters sometimes sent in false alarms. If 
          they were caught, police took them to their parents to be dealt with 
          rather than taking them to the local jail. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The year was 1933 
          in West Durham, North Carolina. I was in the seventh grade at the E.K. 
          Powe School. The school faculty and administrative officers took Fire 
          Prevention Week as a serious matter. All students took home a Fire Prevention 
          form for their parents to fill out. Those who forgot to bring them back 
          to their teachers were sent home to get them. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Fire Department 
          did its part. The firemen went around visiting the schools. They would 
          pull their big red fire trucks onto the school grounds and give talks 
          on what to do in case of fire and instruct the students in how to prevent 
          fires. In addition, they demonstrated how they used their equipment. 
          We were allowed to sit in the driver's seat, tap the siren and ring 
          the bell. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The grand finale 
          of the firemen's visit was to show us how to jump into a fire rescue 
          net if we were ever caught in an upper story of a burning building. 
          They announced that they would be calling for students who wished to 
          volunteer to jump. They brought out the large circular rope net. The 
          firemen and several of the largest high school senior boys picked up 
          the net by the hand grips around its edge. Then we looked up and saw 
          a fireman standing in the large window opening on the second floor. 
          He hollered down to us, explaining the exact procedure to follow in 
          doing a jump. He did leap and landed perfectly in a sitting position. 
          It looked easy. They asked for any students who wanted to jump to come 
          forward. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">I was there like 
          a bolt of lightning and went dashing up the side steps inside the building. 
          I was the first in line, but I did have some second thoughts when I 
          looked around and saw that there were only six or seven others. One 
          boy got cold feet and went back downstairs. There were no two ways about 
          it: he was going to be labeled a "scaredy cat" for the rest of the week. 
          </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The fireman who 
          had demonstrated the jump was standing by the large open window. He 
          once again told us how to jump and how to hit the net. I was ready. 
          Before I stepped up on the window ledge, I looked back at the ones behind 
          me. I saw that my little sister, Betsy Ann, had come upstairs and was 
          on the end of the line, behind the boys. I should explain that she was 
          always following me around, trying to copy everything I did. Being her 
          oldest brother, I had to look after her lots of times, like having to 
          watch out for her walking back and forth to school each day. She just 
          took this kind of sibling supervision to mean she could go wherever 
          I went. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">But I was not worried 
          about her jumping. She was in no danger since she was probably as good 
          an acrobat as anyone in school. Back bends, walk on her hands, stand 
          on her head, turn cartwheels, do the split-she could do all those athletic 
          things even if she were just a chubby short girl. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The fireman helped 
          me up into the window opening. I looked down that second story height 
          to the ring of men holding the net below, waiting to catch me. I felt 
          as if I were looking down on Corcoran Street from the top of the Washington 
          Duke Hotel downtown. This was the point of no return. I jumped. Everything 
          went well and I was bursting with pride as they lowered the net and 
          let me walk off. I moved away so that I could watch the ones who followed 
          me, especially to see my little sister's jump. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">One tubby fellow 
          must have thought that he was doing a "cannonball" leap into Crystal 
          Lake. He held his nose when he jumped. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">I waited and waited 
          for my sister. She did not come. Given her unusual athletic skill, surely 
          she could not have cold feet? However, the well-bred, conventional fireman 
          would not let her jump for a very traditional reason for that era. Betsy 
          Ann was a girl. She was wearing a dress. </font>
