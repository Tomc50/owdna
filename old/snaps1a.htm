    the back of the basement (with an alley entrance) while furs were stored 
    in the front of the basement (where books are now stored). Folks thought

      Luther King's assassination, the front of Morgan's Cafe was hit with 
      a lit gasoline-filled bottle. Farther down Ninth, Couch's Furniture 
      Store was burned to the ground. Garland &quot;Speck&quot; Morgan had moved to 
      Durham to help his father run L&amp;M Restaurant downtown -- before 
      establishing Morgan's Cafe. The Morgan family hailed from the mill village 
      of Reidsville (north of Greensboro). One of Speck Morgan's granddaughters

  Brueggers Bagel Bakery &amp; CCI Photographics was once Wachovia Bank. 
  A couple of two-story mill houses stood across Ninth Street from the 
  old bank (where Specs and Alpha Graphics are now located). Their yards 
  backed up to the large mill pond on the corner. The Collins and Fergerson 
  families lived in the wood frame houses. Betty Collins went to EK Powe, 
  married Don Schlitz and their son grew up to compose &quot;The Gambler&quot; (the 
  song made famous by Kenny Rogers and was eventually made into a movie 
  of the same name). </font></p>
