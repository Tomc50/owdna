    -Missouri Humanities  Council</p>
  <p><span style="color: Navy">Chapel  Hill (&amp; Carrboro) may be the most liberal town in NC, but if you really  want diversity (of all types) and affordability then Durham is more for you. The areas around  downtown like Brightleaf, Trinity Park, Old West Durham and Old North Durham are some  of the most liberal neighborhoods in North    Carolina... but the city as a whole is definitely  very Blue. It's a quirky atmosphere too... not just hippy liberal like Chapel Hill is, but a city with a strong vein of  independence and nonconformity in it too.</span> <br />

The most coveted are Watts-Hillandale, Trinity Park,  Northgate Park  and Old West Durham, all near Duke   University.  Unfortunately, prices have gone up and homes are not as affordable as they used  to be.&quot;</span><br />

    the incredible diversity of population. There's a certain level of

    of itself that the others don't.&quot; <br />

    and a lot of &quot;cultural vibrancy&quot; in the surrounding neighborhood.

    what 
    would make me visit that quaint strip more often; what did I miss most
    about the city. A Tapas Bar became the perfect answer: an excellent
    
    conduit for good food, great conversation, a relaxed but vibrant atmosphere,
    good wine, and a bit of the old world mixed in. The club side, named
    
    simply, &quot;9&quot; would just cinch the concept together and extend the option
    of a nightlife: a place to listen to awesome live jazz, a nice ska
    groove, 
    soulful blues, sensual Brazilian music, a kickass band, or a banging
    DJ.&quot;<br />

    briskly 
    through drab autumnal streets, descending finally a long rutted hill

    if chill menace. There was a brooding quietness, broken by far small
    
    sounds. They turned into a sordid little road, unpaved, littered on
    both sides... it was a road of rickets.&quot;</font><font size="2"><br />
