          <font size="2">The Old West Durham Neighborhood Association hosted an 
          informal, hands-on workshop that demonstrated how to lay down an automatic 
          drip irrigation system and explored the beauty of NC native plants.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><img src="graphics/workshop/Drought3.jpg" width="399" height="278"></font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Folks learned how to 1) set up an automatic watering 
          system using only one outdoor spigot, 2) lay soaker hose, and 3) maximize 
          the use of native and drought-resistant plants to conserve water. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><img src="graphics/workshop/Drought4.jpg" width="404" height="182"></font></p>
        <p><font size="2">More than 70 participants first viewed a garden with 
          a working automatic soaker hose system on Carolina Avenue and then went 
          to an adjacent yard to observe the placement of a drought-resistant 
          watering system using soaker hose, Y-connectors, and automatic timers.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><img src="graphics/workshop/Drought1.jpg" width="395" height="280"></font><font size="2"> 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The free workshop also offered an opportunity to answer 
          questions about gardening with native plants, native plant sources, 
          starting a butterfly-attracting garden, and incorporating edible plants 
          into the landscape.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Benefits:</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">* Water conservation measures help gardens look beautiful 
          even in drought conditions (and saves money too).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">* Setting your yard on a timed-drip irrigation system 
          allows you to go on vacation in the summer heat and return to a green 
          and healthy yard.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">* The use of native plants in NC gardens cuts down on 
          water use, staking, and fertilizer. Native plants enhance the beauty 
          of your yard, come back bigger and better each year, and create habitats 
          that encourage butterflies.</font></p>

        <p><b><font color="Green">How does this garden grow? Very little water 
          </font></b></p>
        <p>(Herald-Sun, 7/14/02)</p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">As a doctor specializing 
          in breast cancer, Victoria Seewaldt grew all too familiar with death 
          and dying. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Duke physician 
          remembers coming home from her long days in residence at the University 
          of Washington in Seattle and needing an escape. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I needed to go 
          home and deal with something living," she said. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">So she started 
          planting. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">She and her husband, 
          Eric Dietze, started with a few potted plants. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Then the two got 
          jobs at Duke and moved to Durham with their 5-year-old daughter, Erin. 
          They bought a house on a spacious lot, a blank canvas for the amateur 
          gardeners. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Today, more than 
          400 plants grow in their miniature botanical garden. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">But even with an 
          estimated $10,000 invested in trees, shrubs and other plants, the couple 
          doesn&acute;t even flinch at the word "drought." Water restrictions 
          recently adopted in the Triangle were a way of life for them in California 
          and Seattle. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"One summer, there 
          was no external watering allowed at all," Seewaldt said. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">And so the two 
          learned gardening techniques that conserved as much water as possible. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">They replaced the 
          grass in their yard with mulch. They sought out native plants from local 
          nurseries. And they shunned sprinklers in favor of buried hoses that 
          deliver a slow, steady drip. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Consequently, the 
          family&acute;s yard at 901 Carolina Ave. has remained fresh and green 
          throughout this arid spring and summer. Robins flock there to munch 
          on worms. Mosquitoes abound. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Neighbors have 
          noticed the yard&acute;s unusual lushness, Seewaldt said. And now Seewaldt 
          and Dietze are trying to teach others what they learned from living 
          with a meager water supply. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"The whole business 
          of water conservation is very common on the West Coast, but people in 
          the South haven&acute;t really considered it," said Seewaldt. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The issue probably 
          won&acute;t go away even if and when the rains return. Other cities 
          in the Southeast, such as Atlanta, are struggling with water demand 
          that constantly exceeds the supply because of rapid development. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The best way to 
          change habits, Seewaldt says, is through leading by example. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"We&acute;re hoping 
          to teach our neighbors what we&acute;ve learned," she said. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Much mulch </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The rich garden 
          the couple now boasts didn&acute;t start out so beautiful. For four 
          or five months, the two covered their yard 3 inches deep in cardboard. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Our neighbors 
          were very patient with us," Seewaldt said, describing the cardboard 
          boxes that littered the yard. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">On top of that 
          went 6 to 8 inches of mulch, topped with pine needles. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Dietze estimates 
          a few hundred yards of hose weave under the mulch. Water seeps out slowly 
          into the soil instead of evaporating or blowing off the lawn as with 
          traditional sprinklers. The hoses are connected to automatic timers. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Most of the plants 
          are native to North Carolina, one of the keys to helping the garden 
          survive during dry conditions. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Seewaldt and Dietze 
          heeded each plant&acute;s needs, determining whether it flourished better 
          in shade or sun. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">They also tried 
          to avoid over-fertilizing, letting the plant overcome its enemies naturally. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"It&acute;s like 
          our bodies," Seewaldt said, "If we get a cold, our immune system fights 
          it off. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Wendy Wenk, greenhouse 
          and nursery manager for the N.C. Botanical Garden in Chapel Hill, said 
          there are a number of native drought-resistant plants to choose from. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Wildflowers like 
          black-eyed Susan, butterfly weed and Joe Pye weed flourish in dry climates. 
          Seewaldt has all three in her yard. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Other native plants 
          that can survive drought include asters, several types of indigo, sneezeweed 
          and a variety of spices, such as rosemary and thyme. Plants like the 
          scarlet rose-mallow bloom bright red flowers during dry conditions. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"It&acute;s so 
          beautiful, and you&acute;d never believe it&acute;s native," Seewaldt 
          said, eyeing the bloom in her yard. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The plants require 
          regular maintenance during the first year, which includes irrigating 
          deeply every week to 10 days, Wenk said. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">But after that, 
          the plants can survive on their own with nature&acute;s watering. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"It just involves 
          choosing the right plant for the right spot," Wenk said. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">It also means avoiding 
          plants considered invasive to North Carolina&acute;s natural habitat. 
          Plants like kudzu or Japanese honeysuckle compete with native plants 
          and overtake them, eventually disrupting the balance of the habitat. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The beauty of going 
          native </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">More homeowners 
          are realizing the benefits of putting native plants in their yard, said 
          Ken Moore, assistant director of the N.C. Botanical Garden. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">But developers 
          are still razing land and covering it with concrete at enormous rates, 
          which will only increase the amount of water being wasted. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The more concrete 
          and buildings, the better chance water will run off and be wasted instead 
          of being absorbed into the ground and replenishing wells. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">True water conservation 
          will be possible when homeowners and developers try to work with the 
          existing landscape and preserve existing vegetation, Moore said. It 
          takes acknowledging that native plants can be just as beautiful as exotic 
          ones. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Seewaldt, Dietze 
          and their daughter Erin have realized that. Along with developing a 
          love for North Carolina&acute;s plants, they&acute;ve adopted the Southern 
          tradition of enjoying the flora from rocking chairs on their front porch. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"For us as a family, 
          this whole thing is close to our hearts," Seewaldt said. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Many homeowners, 
          in their attempt to keep a green, well-manicured lawn, don&acute;t have 
          the same appreciation for the beauty of the state&acute;s native plants, 
          Moore said. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Everyone is trying 
          to keep a Martha Stewart, picture-perfect garden, and I find it so sad," 
          he said. "I just want to be in the woods &#151;- that&acute;s a true 
          garden." </font></p>
