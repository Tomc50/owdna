        <!-- TemplateEndEditable --><!-- TemplateBeginEditable name="Text-Photos" --><p>On a weekday in late May, a week or so after<br>
          graduation, a woman in a Duke University T-shirt sips<br>
          coffee at a sidewalk table here. A few doors down,<br>
          people browse through books for sale on a cart outside<br>
          a bookstore. A waitress at a popular restaurant flits<br>
          between patrons dining alfresco. Dubbed &quot;Durham's<br>
          alternative shopping district&quot; by those who make a<br>
          living here, this stretch of Ninth Street and the<br>
          surrounding area just a few blocks from Duke<br>
          University's East Campus has long been an off-campus<br>
          outlet where Duke students and local residents<br>
          socialize while supporting a business district that is<br>
        an integral part of Old West Durham. </p>
        <p>Lately, though, some local merchants and residents<br>
          have been talking as if Ninth Street's days were<br>
          numbered. </p>
        <p>The source of their anguish is a plan by Duke to<br>
          overhaul its 200-acre Central Campus, which is<br>
          situated between the East and West Campuses and within<br>
          about a mile of Ninth Street. The project's first<br>
          phase calls for new student apartments, restaurants,<br>
          and shops. Duke says it simply wants to serve its<br>
          students better. But some merchants suspect that the<br>
          university is pursuing a strategy to keep more student<br>
          dollars on the campus while providing retail options<br>
          that would also appeal to local residents. They say<br>
          Ninth Street and other business districts in Durham<br>
          would suffer and surrounding neighborhoods would<br>
          eventually be stripped of their character.</p>
        <p>&quot;This is the kind of thing that would cause a slow<br>
          erosion,&quot; says Carol Anderson, owner of Vaguely<br>
          Reminiscent, a clothing, accessory, and gift store<br>
          that has been in business on Ninth Street for 22<br>
          years. &quot;One person would go out of business and then<br>
          another person and then another. It would damage the<br>
          whole persona of what has been a thriving area.&quot; </p>
        <p>The tension recalls the days when Duke's neighbors and<br>
          others in the city saw the university as an isolated,<br>
          arrogant, and sometimes clumsy behemoth that had<br>
          little outward regard for local folk. That image has<br>
          changed in the past decade as Duke has been credited<br>
          with improving the neighborhoods and schools around<br>
          its sprawling campus. But clearly, as far as the<br>
          relationship between the elite, wealthy, private<br>
          university and some local residents is concerned,<br>
          mistrust continues to lurk beneath the surface. </p>
        <p>Conflicts over campus retail services have become<br>
          increasingly common as colleges and universities<br>
          strive to meet the expectations of students, compete<br>
          with other universities, and in many instances draw<br>
          more student dollars to university coffers. </p>
        <p>At Iowa State University, a new $15-million community<br>
          center offering a variety of eateries has been a<br>
          headache for some nearby restaurant owners who say<br>
          that the center has caused sales to drop as students<br>
          increasingly skip going off campus to buy meals.<br>
          Pennsylvania State University weathered criticism from<br>
          local downtown developers when it renovated and<br>
          expanded its student union four years ago to include<br>
          several restaurants, including national chains.</p>
        <p>As the list of things college students can buy on<br>
          campus continues to grow, merchants in college towns,<br>
          like those on Ninth Street, have to work harder to<br>
          keep students as customers. </p>
        <p>These days laptops, fast food, apparel, books,<br>
          groceries, artwork, and more are all for sale at<br>
          stores just steps away from residence halls or<br>
          classrooms. </p>
        <p>Duke officials have publicly maintained that the<br>
          community's worries are unfounded -- that any<br>
          deterioration to an area so close to the campus would<br>
          hurt Duke as well. That message, however, doesn't<br>
          always resonate amid the fuzzy, sometimes conflicting<br>
          details of a plan that Duke officials insist is a work<br>
          in progress. </p>
        <p>A Gothic Haven</p>
        <p>Shops first began to sprout on Ninth Street around a<br>
          cotton mill that opened in the late 1890s. After<br>
          operating for nearly 100 years, the mill closed in<br>
          1986, which left the once-thriving village in bad<br>
          shape. In addition, a shopping mall that opened on the<br>
          outskirts of town contributed to the transformation of<br>
          Ninth Street into a hodgepodge of vacant storefronts. </p>
        <p>Today, after a concerted effort to redevelop the area,<br>
          Ninth Street is home to a blocklong stretch of<br>
          eclectic stores, trendy restaurants, and bars. Books<br>
          on Ninth, a used-book store, has been there since<br>
          1991. John Browner, the owner of the shop, says<br>
          students shop at his store, but most customers are<br>
          families that live in three neighborhoods near Ninth<br>
          Street. </p>
        <p>&quot;Ninth Street has character, a quality sadly lacking<br>
          in Duke's plans,&quot; said Mr. Browner in an e-mail<br>
          interview. &quot;I jumped at the chance to move my business<br>
          to Ninth Street ... because it's the last place in<br>
          Durham where you can walk up and down the street,<br>
          window-shop, and chat with your neighbors and<br>
          experience town life.&quot; </p>
        <p>The role Duke has played in that town life has evolved<br>
          over the years. For decades the university, the city's<br>
          largest employer, with its reputation as a Gothic<br>
          haven for a privileged few, was viewed with disdain by<br>
          area residents, particularly those who were poor or<br>
          working class. Duke was rapidly building its endowment<br>
          (just over $2.7-billion at the end of March),<br>
          attracting top-notch professors, and cementing its<br>
          role as a premier research institution in a city that<br>
          still struggles with drug and crime problems, a<br>
          crippling poverty rate among residents, and budget<br>
          crunches. </p>
        <p>Then, in 1996, under the leadership of President<br>
          Nannerl O. Keohane, the institution made a conscious<br>
          effort to focus on improving a dozen neighborhoods and<br>
          seven public schools closest to the university. Ms.<br>
          Keohane, who will leave Duke at the end of this month,<br>
          could not be reached for comment. Duke dubbed its<br>
          outreach effort the Neighborhood Partnership<br>
          Initiative and has raised $10-million to help build<br>
          affordable housing, health clinics, and local<br>
          community centers. Many in the city have taken notice.</p>
        <p>&quot;I know firsthand that Duke's contribution to the<br>
          community is priceless,&quot; wrote Ann T. Denlinger,<br>
          superintendent of Durham Public Schools in a letter to<br>
          Duke in March. &quot;Thank you for your ongoing commitment<br>
          to students, schools and community.&quot; </p>
        <p>Meanwhile, neighborhoods in the partnership supported<br>
          the city's new university-college zoning ordinance,<br>
          approved just over a year ago, that was intended to<br>
          make it easier for colleges to develop their campuses.</p>
        <p>The new zoning ordinance permits institutions to build<br>
          dormitories, auditoriums, medical centers, and other<br>
          buildings related to higher education. The ordinance<br>
          also allows &quot;limited retail&quot; uses, such as<br>
&quot;university-related bookstores and dining facilities<br>
located within other buildings&quot; as long as they are<br>
&quot;designed to serve the on-campus population of the<br>
          university and not to attract additional traffic to<br>
          campus.&quot; </p>
        <p>City planning officials created the ordinance with<br>
          input from Durham's three colleges and neighborhoods<br>
          near their campuses. </p>
        <p>A 'Main Street Village'</p>
        <p>Everyone agrees that the 1970s-era apartments on the<br>
          Central Campus must be replaced. But Duke officials,<br>
          who talk frequently about leaving their options open,<br>
          have not been clear about such specifics as the kind<br>
          of retail services the university wants to put on the<br>
          Central Campus, how much space it plans to dedicate to<br>
          those businesses, and how the new Central Campus, with<br>
          retail outlets that would be tax-exempt, would<br>
          complement locally owned businesses nearby, rather<br>
          than hurt them. </p>
        <p>&quot;We're certainly not trying to compete with anybody or<br>
          build a destination shopping center,&quot; says Tallman<br>
          Trask III, executive vice president at Duke and one of<br>
          the key architects of the plan to remake the Central<br>
          Campus. &quot;People want me to give information based on<br>
          what I don't know. Lots of things could happen with<br>
          this. We just don't know.&quot; </p>
        <p>For the most part, the Central Campus has served as a<br>
          thoroughfare between Duke's East and West Campuses,<br>
          where most classroom buildings are located, since it<br>
          was created almost 40 years ago. Duke officials want<br>
          that to change. In the year or so of discussions about<br>
          what the Central Campus could become, officials have<br>
          talked of turning it into a &quot;town center&quot; or &quot;Main<br>
          Street village&quot; of sorts over the next 50 to 75 years.</p>
        <p>The aging apartments on the Central Campus, where<br>
          about 1,000 undergraduate and graduate students live,<br>
          would be torn down and replaced with two multistory<br>
          residence halls, says Scott F. Selig, associate vice<br>
          president for capital assets, who oversees Duke's<br>
          real-estate holdings. And Duke would work with<br>
          developers to bring retail services to the Central<br>
          Campus, possibly in the ground floor of the new<br>
          residence halls. Duke's current retail offerings,<br>
          scattered among all three campuses, are typical of<br>
          many colleges and include a bookstore, a computer<br>
          store, three convenience stores, and a Mexican<br>
          cantina-style restaurant in the student center. Some<br>
          of the retail outlets Duke already has could be<br>
          relocated to the Central Campus, officials say. </p>
        <p>Over the next several decades, the Central Campus<br>
          could also include offices and housing for faculty and<br>
          staff members -- which would put part of the Central<br>
          Campus back on Durham's property tax rolls. Other<br>
          possibilities include a small hotel, a bowling alley,<br>
          and an auditorium.</p>
        <p>No firm price tag has been attached to the<br>
          redevelopment, but officials have estimated several<br>
          hundred million dollars. </p>
        <p>&quot;You get one shot to develop something like this,&quot;<br>
          says Mr. Selig. &quot;We want to make it a place that has<br>
          an identity. Right now Central Campus is lacking<br>
          that.&quot; </p>
        <p>Such a &quot;town center&quot; would be a &quot;Duke place,&quot; Mr.<br>
          Selig says. &quot;Not something for all the region, or for<br>
          Durham, but for Duke.&quot; </p>
        <p>Duke officials initially appeared to embrace the new<br>
          zoning-district ordinance. Neighborhood groups found<br>
          out, however, that Duke wanted to change parts of two<br>
          clauses in the ordinance: &quot;limited retail&quot; and<br>
&quot;on-campus population.&quot; Duke wanted the city to shave<br>
off the words &quot;limited&quot; and &quot;on,&quot; which would broaden<br>
          both the kinds of retail services that would be<br>
          allowed and the customers they could serve. </p>
        <p>Residents sent e-mail messages to Duke officials,<br>
          questioning the institution's motives. Although Duke<br>
          eventually rescinded its request and removed the<br>
          Central Campus from its proposed university district,<br>
          some say the damage was done. </p>
        <p>&quot;What happened doesn't make me feel so good,&quot; says<br>
          Risa Foster, who works as a network systems analyst at<br>
          Duke's Medical Center. She is also president of the<br>
          Trinity Heights Neighborhood Association, which<br>
          supported the zoning. &quot;I love Duke. They're a good<br>
          neighbor. But their neighbors and the city have reason<br>
          to be interested in what they're doing.&quot;</p>
        <p>Neighborhood Watch</p>
        <p>Business owners and residents were determined to have<br>
          some say. </p>
        <p>John Schelp, president of the Old West Durham<br>
          Neighborhood Association, armed with in put from other<br>
          neighborhoods and merchants, met Mr. Trask at a Ninth<br>
          Street restaurant about a year ago. Over lunch, they<br>
          talked through what kinds of development on the<br>
          Central Campus would be least harmful to Ninth Street<br>
          merchants and the community. They agreed that<br>
          residence halls, restaurants, a 99-room hotel, a<br>
          bowling alley, a performing-arts center, a Duke<br>
          apparel store, and a bookstore with a coffee shop<br>
          could all be deemed necessary to serve the needs of<br>
          the students living on the campus. </p>
        <p>&quot;We recognize that we live in an urban setting and<br>
          that Duke is a large player,&quot; says Mr. Schelp, who<br>
          acted as lead negotiator for the 12 neighborhoods<br>
          surrounding Duke. &quot;We were trying to be reasonable.&quot; </p>
        <p>Representatives from the neighborhoods endorsed the<br>
          agreement and voted in favor of it. But a year later,<br>
          Mr. Schelp and others began to think that the<br>
          agreement didn't mean much. In March, at the first<br>
          opportunity the public had to view the proposed plans<br>
          for the Central Campus, Duke officials raised the<br>
          possibility that the university might seek more than<br>
          the agreed-upon retail services and that the<br>
          university-college zoning might not be suitable<br>
          either. </p>
        <p>In response, Kay Robin Alexander, a former Duke<br>
          employee and a longtime grass-roots activist in<br>
          Durham, wrote a letter that was published in The<br>
          Herald-Sun, a local newspaper, that said people with<br>
          no ties to Duke &quot;will be drawn to the state-of-the-art<br>
          'town square' design the university plans to build on<br>
          campus.&quot; Others wrote of Duke's plans to &quot;Walmart-ize&quot;<br>
          the Central Campus.</p>
        <p>Groundbreaking for the first phase of the Central<br>
          Campus transformation was to have started as early as<br>
          this fall, but since the public meeting, the &quot;train<br>
          has slowed down a little bit,&quot; Mr. Schelp says.<br>
          Trustees will hear details of the first phase of the<br>
          redevelopment at an October meeting. Meanwhile,<br>
          whatever Duke decides to do must also be approved by<br>
          zoning officials. </p>
        <p>Mr. Trask says Duke officials cannot commit to<br>
&quot;limited retail&quot; because the exact meaning of the term<br>
          is unclear to them. He says that city officials have<br>
          preliminarily told Duke that what it wants to build<br>
          appears to be &quot;limited retail,&quot; but applying for a<br>
&quot;mixed use&quot; designation -- which paves the way for a<br>
          wider range of retail options -- is a possibility. </p>
        <p>Jean Fox O'Barr, founding director of Duke's<br>
          women's-studies program, lives close to the Central<br>
          Campus on a street filled mostly with fellow faculty<br>
          members. &quot;We are all concerned with the nature of the<br>
          development and the apparent lack of clarity in what<br>
          is being proposed, promised [and] planned,&quot; said Ms.<br>
          O'Barr in an e-mail message.</p>
        <p>Rom Coles, a political-science professor at Duke,<br>
          e-mailed that although there has been some improvement<br>
          in Duke's relationship with the &quot;broader Durham<br>
          community, many of us think there is still a long way<br>
          to go before Duke is doing its full share.&quot; </p>
        <p>Indeed, Durham city leaders have long asked Duke to<br>
          make an annual payment to the city in lieu of the<br>
          property and sales taxes it doesn't have to pay<br>
          because, as a nonprofit educational institution, it is<br>
          largely tax-exempt. </p>
        <p>Just last month, Durham's city manager, in a letter to<br>
          Ms. Keohane, asked Duke to pay $1-million a year for<br>
          the next decade and give at least $10-million to help<br>
          pay for a performing-arts center proposed for<br>
          downtown. A few wealthy institutions, such as Harvard<br>
          and Yale Universities, already make payments to their<br>
          cities in lieu of taxes, and Tufts University recently<br>
          agreed to do so. </p>
        <p>Duke officials say they might charge retailers enough<br>
          rent to cover what Duke would pay in property taxes<br>
          and then give that money to local government, but<br>
&quot;we're not going to give up our tax-exempt status,&quot;<br>
          says John F. Burness Sr., senior vice president for<br>
          public affairs and government relations. Once people<br>
          move into the homes likely to be built on Central<br>
          Campus land, that would increase the density around<br>
          Ninth Street, Mr. Burness says, &quot;and traffic would<br>
          increase over there.&quot;</p>
        <p>Ms. Anderson, one of the Ninth Street merchants, sees<br>
          it differently. &quot;I think it is inherently wrong,&quot; she<br>
          says, &quot;for an institution to make money off retail and<br>
          be in competition in a city where they pay no taxes.&quot;<br>
