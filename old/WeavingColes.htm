        <p>Mary Coles remembers the circuses that used to parade through West
          Durham. She liked the elephants and the horses. She remembers the boarders
          her mother took in, her country ham and biscuits, and climbing trees,
          and politicians, gathering in McDonald's drugstore and shaking hands
        outside the gates of Erwin Mills. Her daddy was head of the union there.</p>
        <p>&quot;Time moves on,&quot; she said.</p>
        <p>So it does. West Durham is now better known as just &quot;Ninth Street,&quot; hip
          and counter-culturish. Once, though, it was a cotton-mill village,
          working-class and familial. And that West Durham, the myriad mill villages
          like it, and memories like Mary Coles', are suddenly the focus of a
          trend.</p>
        <p>&quot;It's finally dawning on people that the Southern textile culture
          may not be with us much longer,&quot; Lynn Rumley said.</p>
        <p>Rumley is a former West Durham resident who said she has found herself
          part of &quot;a spontaneous movement ... to take stock of what's going
          to be gone soon.&quot; According to present West Durham chronicler
          John Schelp, Rumley is &quot;the heart and soul behind&quot; that movement,
          which has led to a &quot;Southwide Cotton Mill Reunion &amp; Convention&quot; next
          weekend in Kannapolis. (For information, go to www.textileheritage.org/reunioninfo1.htm.)</p>
        <p>Rumley organized the event. Schelp is going to talk about how to reinvigorate
          mill-village neighborhoods, using Old West Durham as a case in point.</p>
        <p>&quot;John has done an extraordinary job of preserving history,&quot; said
          Rumley. With the Southern textile industry dying, even the memories
          are an endangered species, she said.</p>
        <p>&quot;Our elders are passing on,&quot; Rumley said. &quot;The last
          generation to grow up Mill Hill-style are the same age as the World
          War II generation.&quot;</p>
        <p>Mary Coles is one of those elders. Her late husband, Louis, was another
          West Durham native, but they only met on a blind date, when he was
          home on leave from the Durham Machine Gun Company. West Durham memories
          were something they shared in later years: snake handlers, medicine
          shows, lint in their lungs and rocking on the front porch.</p>
        <p>&quot;Nobody back then had to lock their doors,&quot; Rumley said. &quot;Everybody
          knew everybody by first names. The values they practiced, a lot of
          us envy. The children who grew up, whose ancestors were cotton-mill
          people, they need to know this and be proud of it.&quot;</p>
        <p>Preservationists are on the job.</p>
        <p>Mary Coles has her memories.</p>
        <p>&quot;I can remember laying in bed at night,&quot; she said. &quot;They
          had steam trains then, you could hear those trains coming waaayyy off,
          and they'd get closer and closer and then they'd get to rattling the
          window. And, I don't know, that always just ... &quot; and she stopped.</p>
        <p>&quot;I think about the past a lot,&quot; she said.</p>
        <p>&quot;There'll never be another place like West Durham&quot;<br>
