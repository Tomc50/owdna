<h2>Neighborhood Protection Overlay</h2>

<p class="owdna-p">
  How much do you know about the zoning of our neighborhood? Did you 
  know that there are no protections on historic structures in OWD? Or 
  that your neighbor is currently allowed to chop down all of their trees, 
  and build a 45-foot (3 story) house (or even a rooming house) on their lot?
</p>

<p class="owdna-p">
  It's true. That's why the OWDNA board, with the encouragement of the 
  Planning Department and 96 unique landowners in the neighborhood who 
  signed a Petition of Support, is pursuing the feasibility of a Neighborhood 
  Protection Overlay (NPO) for Old West Durham, which would alter the zoning 
  to be more protective of the neighborhood's character.
  
</p>

<p class="owdna-p">
  What our proposed NPO addresses are the height and width of
  new buildings, encouragement to plant backyard trees (since street trees are the purview of the City),
  loosening off-street parking requirements,
  and encouraging further density with accessory dwelling units as affordable housing options in our increasingly
  expensive community. Guidelines that may temper incentives for developers to tear down small historic houses
  to build maximum-size (45'-tall) buildings with maximizing rents; and guidelines that simultaneously protect
  the character of the community.
</p>

<p class="owdna-p">
  OWDNA originally submitted an application to the Planning Department to start exploring NPO
    options with neighbors in 2014. The first public meeting was on January 31, 2017 at E.K.
  Powe Elementary School and 16 other open-invite or public-notice meetings followed in 2017. An NPO working group drafted NPO content during 10
    work sessions in summer/fall/winter 2017-2018. OWDNA voted unanimously to endorse the resulting neighborhood protection overlay on
    January 25, 2018. To get involved, watch this space for updates, contact the OWDNA
  Board at owdna-board[at]googlegroups[dot]com, or attend a OWDNA Board meeting!

  Thhe three drafts of the NPO language are linked below, illustrating the progress from first version through final submitted version. Documents
  explaining what decisions were made in each revision and why were provided by the NPO working group. These are linked here as well.
