<h2>Neighborhood Protection Overlay</h2>

<p class="owdna-p">
  How much do you know about the zoning of our neighborhood? Did you 
  know that there are no protections on historic structures in OWD? Or 
  that your neighbor is currently allowed to chop down all of their trees, 
  and build a 45-foot (3 story) house (or even a rooming house) on their lot?
</p>

<p class="owdna-p">
  It's true. That's why the OWDNA board, with the encouragement of the 
  Planning Department, has been collecting signatures of neighbors interested 
  in pursuing a Neighborhood Protection Overlay (NPO) for Old West Durham, which 
  would slightly modify the zoning to be more protective of the neighborhood's 
  character. 
</p>

<p class="owdna-p">
  What our NPO would likely regulate would be only the height and width of 
  new buildings, and possibly to what extent large trees may be cut: things 
  that may temper incentives for developers to tear down small historic houses 
  and build maximum-size (45'-tall) buildings to maximize rents, at the expense 
  of the character of the street. 
</p>

<p class="owdna-p">
  If you think this is a good idea, you may sign this electronic petition, or 
  ask a board member, or send an email to oldwestdurham@gmail.com asking a board 
  member to contact you. Signing the petition only signifies a willingness to 
  start the process with the Planning Department, as specifics of the NPO are a 
  still a distant future. Your signature does not commit you to the future plan. 
  We will remain in contact with neighbors throughout the process.
</p>

<p class="owdna-p">
  The first step is to get everybody to sign the petition! About five dozen neighbors 
  have already signed- add your name to the list!
