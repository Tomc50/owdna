<h2>Neighborhood Protection Overlay</h2>

<p class="owdna-p">
  How much do you know about the zoning of our neighborhood? Did you 
  know that there are no protections on historic structures in OWD? Or 
  that your neighbor is currently allowed to chop down all of their trees, 
  and build a 45-foot (3 story) house (or even a rooming house) on their lot?
</p>

<p class="owdna-p">
  It's true. That's why the OWDNA board, with the encouragement of the 
  Planning Department and 96 unique landowners in the neighborhood who 
  signed a Petition of Support, is pursuing the feasibility of a Neighborhood 
  Protection Overlay (NPO) for Old West Durham, which would alter the zoning 
  to be more protective of the neighborhood's character.
  
</p>

<p class="owdna-p">
  What our NPO would likely regulate would be only the height and width of 
  new buildings, and possibly to what extent large trees may be cut: things 
  that may temper incentives for developers to tear down small historic houses 
  and build maximum-size (45'-tall) buildings to maximize rents, at the expense 
  of the character of the street. 
</p>

<p class="owdna-p">
  OWDNA and the Planning Department have started initial discussions about 
  what an NPO might entail. The first public meeting was on January 31, 2017 at E.K.
  Powe Elementary School from 7-8:30 PM. And OWDNA members are always receptive to input 
  from neighbors. To get involved, watch this space for updates, contact the OWDNA 
  Board at owdna-board[at]googlegroups[dot]com, or attend a OWDNA Board meeting!
